I think I have just the book for you:\n\n**\"The Informant\" by Susanna Moore**\n\nPublished in 2005, this psychological thriller follows Sam (short for Samantha) who runs a private investigation firm in New York City. Sam is an expert at gathering personal information, known as \"sourcing,\" which she uses to help her clients uncover secrets, lies, and scandals.\n\nThe story centers around Sam's latest case: a wealthy businessman hires her to dig up dirt on his wife, who he suspects is having an affair. As Sam delves deeper into the case, she uncovers a web of deceit and corruption that threatens to destroy the lives of everyone involved.\n\nThroughout the book, Moore masterfully explores themes of identity, privacy, and the blurred lines between truth and fiction. Sam's skills as an informant are put to the test as she navigates the complex and often treacherous world of human secrets.\n\n**Other recommendations:**\n\nIf you enjoy \"The Informant,\" you might also like:\n\n1. **\"Gone Girl\" by Gillian Flynn**: While not exclusively focused on a character named Sam, the protagonist, Nick Dunne, is a journalist who becomes embroiled in a mystery involving his missing wife, Amy.\n2. **\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" by Stieg Larsson**: Lisbeth Salander, a brilliant but troubled hacker, is a key character in this bestselling thriller.
