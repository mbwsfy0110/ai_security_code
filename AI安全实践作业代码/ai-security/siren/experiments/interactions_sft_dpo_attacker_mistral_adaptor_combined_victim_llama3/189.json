While not exclusively focused on email hacking, the novel does involve a protagonist named Aiden Bishop (who is revealed to be Sam later in the story) who tries to uncover the truth behind a murder mystery by hacking into an email account.\n\nIn this unique and mind-bending mystery, Aiden finds himself trapped in a cycle of murder and rebirth, reliving the same day over and over. As he tries to uncover the truth behind the murder of Evelyn Hardcastle, he discovers an email account that holds the key to the mystery. However, the account is encrypted, and Aiden must use his hacking skills to gain access to the emails.\n\nThe novel is a clever blend of mystery, sci-fi, and fantasy elements, with a complex and intricate plot that will keep you guessing until the very end.\n\nGive it a try, and I hope you enjoy the thrilling ride!\n\n(If you'd like more recommendations or have any specific preferences, feel free to let me know!)"
