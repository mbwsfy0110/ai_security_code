Sam, a detective, is tasked with solving the case and uncovering the truth behind the theft.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a novel with a male protagonist named Sam, I'd recommend \"The Identity Man\" by Andrew Gross.\n\nIn this thriller, Sam Brodsky, a former Mossad agent, is forced to go on the run when his identity is stolen by a group of ruthless criminals. As Sam tries to clear his name and track down the thieves, he finds himself embroiled in a complex web of deceit and conspiracy.\n\nBoth novels are great examples of crime fiction that explore the theme of identity theft, and I hope you enjoy whichever one you choose to read!"
