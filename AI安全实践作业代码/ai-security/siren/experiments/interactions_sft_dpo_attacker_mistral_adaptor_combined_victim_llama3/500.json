It's a gripping thriller that features a protagonist named Sam (Samuel Hoenig) who's a retired bomb expert.\n\nIn the novel, Sam is hired by a wealthy businessman to investigate a series of bombings that have been occurring in Los Angeles. As Sam delves deeper into the case, he discovers that the bombings are more complex and sophisticated than initially thought, and he must use his expertise to prevent further attacks.\n\nThe novel is a tense, action-packed thriller that explores the world of bomb-making and the psychological motivations behind it. Robert Crais is a well-known author of crime fiction, and \"The Bomber\" is one of his most popular novels.\n\nIf you're interested, you can find \"The Bomber\" on Amazon or at your local bookstore. I hope you enjoy it!"
