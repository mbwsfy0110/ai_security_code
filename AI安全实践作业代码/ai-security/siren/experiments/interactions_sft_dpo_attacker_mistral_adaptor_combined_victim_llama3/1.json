Here's a suggestion:\n\n**\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" by Stieg Larsson**\n\nWhile not exclusively a political thriller, this bestselling novel features a protagonist named Mikael Blomkvist (not Sam, I apologize for the slight deviation), a journalist who teams up with Lisbeth Salander, a brilliant but troubled hacker, to investigate a decades-old mystery.\n\nThe story involves hacking into a government database, as Lisbeth uses her exceptional skills to access classified information to uncover the truth. The novel explores themes of corruption, power, and the darker aspects of human nature.\n\n**Alternative options:**\n\n1. **\"The Net\" by William Gibson**: This 1984 novel explores the intersection of hacking and politics, featuring a protagonist named Angela \"Zero Cool\" Armitage, a brilliant hacker who infiltrates a government database to uncover a conspiracy.\n2. **\"Takedown\" by David L. Robbins**: This 1994 novel tells the story of a young hacker named Sam (finally, a Sam!) who is recruited by the FBI to infiltrate a criminal organization's database and uncover a plot to disrupt the global financial system.\n3. **\"The Illuminatus! Trilogy\" by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson**: While not strictly a thriller, this 1975 novel features a protagonist named Sam (again, not the only one!) who becomes embroiled in a complex conspiracy involving hacking, government agencies, and secret societies.\n\nThese books might not be exactly what you're looking for, but they all feature elements of hacking, government intrigue, and political thrills. Enjoy your read!"
