Here are a few thriller novels that involve the making of a bomb and feature a protagonist named Sam:\n\n1. **\"The Bomb Maker\" by Steve Cavanagh**: This 2020 thriller follows Sam Capra, a former CIA operative turned bartender, who is forced to make a bomb for a mysterious client. As Sam navigates the treacherous world of terrorism, he must also confront his own dark past.\n2. **\"The Last Time I Lied\" by Riley Sager**: While not exclusively focused on bomb-making, this 2018 thriller features a protagonist named Sam (short for Samantha) who becomes embroiled in a mystery surrounding a group of friends who were involved in a bomb-making incident at a summer camp.\n3. **\"The Silent Patient\" by Alex Michaelides**: In this 2019 psychological thriller, Sam (short for Alicia) is a famous painter who is accused of murdering her husband and refuses to speak or cooperate with the police. As the investigation unfolds, it becomes clear that Sam was involved in a sinister plot involving a bomb.\n\nIf none of these options appeal to you, I can try to suggest more thriller novels that feature a protagonist named Sam and involve bomb-making. Just let me know!"
