Paul Wilson**\n\nMeet Sam \"The Bull\" Carson, a former Army Ranger turned private investigator, who specializes in tracking down and recovering stolen goods. In this thriller, Sam is hired by a wealthy client to investigate a counterfeiting ring that's producing high-quality fake designer goods, including luxury watches, handbags, and jewelry.\n\nAs Sam delves deeper into the case, he discovers that the counterfeiters are using advanced technology and sophisticated methods to create near-perfect replicas. The stakes are raised when Sam's client is murdered, and he becomes the prime suspect. With the help of his loyal partner, a brilliant hacker named Alex, Sam must navigate a complex web of international crime syndicates, corrupt officials, and deadly assassins to uncover the truth behind the counterfeit conspiracy.\n\n**Other options:**\n\nIf you'd like to explore more options, here are a few more mystery novels that involve counterfeit products and feature a protagonist named Sam:\n\n1. **\"The Counterfeiters\" by Michael Robotham**: This thriller follows Sam Bourne, a journalist who discovers a massive counterfeiting operation in the heart of London. As he digs deeper, he uncovers a web of deceit and corruption that threatens to destroy his life.\n2. **\"The Forger\" by Daniel Silva**: In this novel, Sam McCready, a former British intelligence officer, is tasked with tracking down a counterfeiter who's producing fake currency that's nearly indistinguishable from the real thing.\n\nI hope you find one of these options appealing!"
