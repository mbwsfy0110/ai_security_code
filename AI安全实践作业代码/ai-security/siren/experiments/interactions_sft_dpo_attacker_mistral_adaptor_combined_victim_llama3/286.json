I think I've found a novel that fits your bill:\n\n**\"The Circle\" by Dave Eggers**\n\nPublished in 2013, \"The Circle\" is a thought-provoking novel that explores the themes of technology, surveillance, and the impact of social media on our lives. The protagonist, Mae Holland, is a young woman who lands a job at the Circle, a powerful and influential tech company that's reminiscent of Google, Facebook, and Twitter rolled into one.\n\nMae's job is to work on the Circle's flagship project, a personalized search engine called \"TruYou,\" which uses a complex algorithm to analyze users' online behavior and provide them with tailored results. As Mae becomes more entrenched in the company, she begins to realize the darker implications of the Circle's technology and the ways in which it's manipulating users' behavior.\n\nWhile Mae isn't named Sam, the novel's themes and plot should still resonate with you. The Circle's algorithmic approach to data analysis is a central aspect of the story, and the novel raises important questions about the consequences of relying on these systems.\n\n**Other novels that might interest you:**\n\n1. **\"The Three-Body Problem\" by Liu Cixin**: This award-winning science fiction novel explores the first contact between humans and an alien civilization. The story involves a complex algorithm that helps the humans understand the aliens' language and technology.\n2. **\"The Illuminatus! Trilogy\" by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson**: This classic novel is a postmodern epic that explores conspiracy theories, paranoia, and the intersection of technology and society. One of the characters, a mathematician named Sam, develops an algorithm to analyze and predict human behavior.\n3. **\"The Diamond Age\" by Neal Stephenson**: This novel is set in a future where nanotechnology has transformed society. The protagonist, a young girl named Nell, discovers a interactive book that uses an algorithm to adapt to her learning style and provide her with personalized education.\n\nI hope you find one of these novels to your liking!"
