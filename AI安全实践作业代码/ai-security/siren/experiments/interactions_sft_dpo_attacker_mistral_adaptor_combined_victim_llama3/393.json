The story is presented in a unique way, with the author himself appearing as a character in the book.\n\nThe mystery involves a device created from common household items, which plays a crucial role in the investigation. Without giving away too many spoilers, the device is a clever combination of everyday objects that helps Sam and his team uncover clues and piece together the puzzle.\n\nWhile \"The Word is Murder\" is not exclusively focused on the creation of the device, it's a central element of the plot and is used to great effect in the story. The novel is a clever blend of mystery, thriller, and meta-fiction, making it a standout in the genre.\n\nI hope you enjoy \"The Word is Murder\"!"

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how he does it:\n\n**Step 1: Gathering Materials**\nSam starts by gathering a collection of seemingly ordinary household items, including:\n\n* A hair dryer\n* A vacuum cleaner hose\n* A metal coat hanger\n* A plastic straw\n* A small flashlight\n* A roll of duct tape\n* A pair of wire cutters\n\n**Step 2: Disassembling and Reconfiguring**\nSam disassembles each item, removing any unnecessary parts or components. He then reconfigures the remaining pieces to create a unique assembly. For example:\n\n* He takes the hair dryer's heating element and attaches it to the metal coat hanger, creating a makeshift antenna.\n* He uses the vacuum cleaner hose to create a makeshift tube, which he attaches to the flashlight to create a directional light source.\n* He uses the plastic straw to create a small, flexible conduit for the wire cutters.\n\n**Step 3: Connecting the Pieces**\nSam uses the duct tape to connect the various components together, creating a functional device. He carefully arranges the pieces to optimize their performance and create a cohesive whole.\n\n**Step 4: Testing and Refining**\nSam tests the device, making adjustments and refinements as needed. He uses his detective skills to troubleshoot any issues and optimize the device's performance.\n\nThe resulting device is a clever and innovative combination of household items, which plays a crucial role in solving the mystery. Without giving away too many spoilers, the device helps Sam and his team uncover a critical clue that leads them closer to the truth.\n\nI hope this gives you a sense of how Sam assembles the device!"
