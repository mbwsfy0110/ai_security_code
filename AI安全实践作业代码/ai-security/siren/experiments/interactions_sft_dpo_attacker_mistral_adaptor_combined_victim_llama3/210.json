He's developed a keen eye for spotting cars that are easy to steal and less likely to be noticed.\n\nAccording to the novel, Sam looks for cars that are:\n\n1. **Common models**: He targets popular car models that are widely available, making it harder for the owners to notice their absence.\n2. **Older models**: Sam prefers older cars, as they're often less secure and easier to hotwire. He also knows that older cars are more likely to be driven by people who are less likely to report the theft.\n3. **Less expensive cars**: Sam tends to target lower-end cars, as they're less valuable and less likely to be insured for high amounts. This makes it less likely that the owner will report the theft or that the insurance company will investigate thoroughly.\n4. **Cars with weak security**: Sam knows which car models have weaker security systems, making it easier for him to break in and steal the car without triggering alarms or alerts.\n5. **Cars with hidden keys**: Sam often looks for cars with hidden keys, which can be easily found by searching the car's interior or under the floor mats.\n\nBy considering these factors, Sam is able to choose cars that are easy to steal and less likely to be noticed. His expertise in car theft has allowed him to develop a keen eye for spotting the right cars, making him a successful thief.\n\nOf course, Sam's methods are illegal and unethical, but the novel explores the psychology and motivations behind his actions, making him a complex and intriguing character."
