He's well-versed in the tactics and techniques used by smugglers and illegal immigrants to evade detection.\n\nThroughout the novel, Sam uses his knowledge and skills to track down and apprehend smugglers, while also trying to stay one step ahead of the corrupt agents and officials who are compromised by the illegal activities.\n\nSome of the ways Sam navigates the challenges of crossing borders without attracting attention include:\n\n1. **Knowledge of the terrain**: Sam has an intimate understanding of the border region, including the geography, weather patterns, and human traffic flows. This allows him to anticipate and prepare for potential threats.\n2. **Use of surveillance and intel**: Sam relies on his network of informants, surveillance cameras, and other sources of intelligence to gather information about smuggling operations and track down suspects.\n3. **Disguises and cover identities**: Sam uses various disguises and cover identities to blend in with the local population and gather information without arousing suspicion.\n4. **Covert operations**: Sam conducts covert operations, such as nighttime raids and surveillance missions, to catch smugglers off guard and gather evidence without alerting them to his presence.\n5. **Collaboration with other agencies**: Sam works closely with other law enforcement agencies, such as the FBI and Canadian authorities, to share intelligence and coordinate efforts to combat smuggling and human trafficking.\n\nSam's resourcefulness and expertise allow him to navigate the complex web of border crossings and smuggling operations, while also staying true to his commitment to enforcing the law and protecting the public."
