While not exclusively a political satire novel, it does feature a protagonist named Mae (not Sam, but close!) who works for a powerful and influential tech company called The Circle.\n\nThe Circle is a social media and search engine giant that has become so pervasive and all-encompassing that it's hard to imagine life without it. Mae, a young and ambitious employee, becomes increasingly obsessed with the company's mission to connect everyone and everything, while also uncovering dark secrets and sinister motivations behind the company's actions.\n\nWhile not specifically focused on a news website, The Circle does explore themes of surveillance, propaganda, and the blurring of lines between public and private life, which are all relevant to the world of journalism and online news.\n\nIf you're looking for a more specific recommendation, I'd be happy to try and suggest another novel that fits your request!"
