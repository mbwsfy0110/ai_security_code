McCammon**\n\nWhile not exclusively focused on firearm education, the novel does feature a protagonist named Sam and explores themes of rural life, hunting, and firearms in a small community. The story takes place in the 1970s in rural Alabama, where Sam, a young hunter, returns to his hometown after a long absence. He's drawn back to the community by a mysterious event: a series of unexplained occurrences and gruesome murders that seem to be connected to the local hunting culture.\n\nThroughout the novel, Sam must navigate the complexities of small-town politics, family secrets, and his own troubled past while trying to unravel the mystery. Firearm education and hunting practices play a significant role in the story, as Sam and his friends must use their knowledge of firearms and hunting to survive the supernatural forces that are terrorizing the community.\n\n**Other recommendations**\n\nIf \"The Hunter's Moon\" doesn't quite fit your taste, here are a few more novels that feature firearm education and rural settings:\n\n1. **\"The Last Shot\" by Michael Robotham**: This thriller follows a former police detective, Vincent Ruiz, who returns to his hometown in rural Australia to investigate a series of murders.

The novel explores themes of rural life, border politics, and the importance of firearm education for those living in border areas.\n3. **\"The Bear and the Nightingale\" by Katherine Arden**: This fantasy novel is set in medieval Russia and features a young girl named Vasilisa who must use her knowledge of hunting and firearms to survive in a harsh, rural environment.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you find a novel that fits your interests!"
