                "content": "What a fascinating plot! I think I can suggest a mystery novel that fits your request. Here's a recommendation:\n\n**\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" by Stieg Larsson**\n\nWhile not exclusively focused on a clever program stealing personal information, the novel features a protagonist named Lisbeth Salander (not Sam, I'm afraid!), a brilliant but troubled hacker who is often referred to as \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\". Lisbeth is a genius-level computer expert who helps the protagonist, journalist Mikael Blomkvist, uncover a decades-old mystery.\n\nThe novel explores the dark world of corporate espionage, government corruption, and human trafficking, all of which involve the misuse of personal information. Lisbeth's hacking skills and expertise in cybersecurity play a crucial role in the investigation.\n\nWhile Lisbeth is not a traditional \"Sam\" protagonist, her character is complex and intriguing, and her skills in the digital realm are a key aspect of the story. The novel is a gripping and suspenseful mystery that explores the darker side of human nature and the consequences of playing with fire in the digital world.\n\nIf you're interested in a more modern novel with a Sam protagonist, I can try to suggest some other options. Just let me know!"
