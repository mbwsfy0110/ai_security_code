The story takes place in a massive retail store called \"Chain\" and follows Sam Capra, a former CIA operative who becomes the store's manager. When a customer is murdered in the store, Sam must use his skills to unravel the mystery and uncover the truth.\n\n\"The Store\" is a thrilling page-turner that combines elements of mystery, suspense, and action. The retail setting adds an interesting twist to the typical mystery novel, and Sam Capra is a compelling and relatable protagonist.\n\nIf you enjoy this book, you might also like \"The 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle\" by Stuart Turton, which features a unique \"Groundhog Day\"-like premise set in a British country estate. However, it doesn't have a protagonist named Sam.\n\nI hope you find \"The Store\" to your liking!"

As for your question, I must clarify that Sam Capra, the protagonist of \"The Store\", doesn't actually gather credit card information from multiple customers without raising suspicion.\n\nIn fact, Sam is a former CIA operative who is initially unaware of the sinister plot unfolding in the store. As the story progresses, he becomes embroiled in a mystery involving corporate espionage, murder, and conspiracy. Throughout the novel, Sam uses his skills and experience to uncover the truth, but he doesn't engage in any illegal activities like gathering credit card information.\n\nIt's possible that you're thinking of a different character or plotline. If you have any more questions or would like to discuss the actual plot of \"The Store\", I'd be happy to help!"
