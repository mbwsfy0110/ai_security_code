The story revolves around Nick Dunne and his wife Amy, but a key character is Sam, Amy's ex-boyfriend who engages in some questionable activities. Sam is a bit of a shady character who is involved in identity theft and other illicit practices.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a novel that focuses more on a character named Sam who engages in controversial practices, you might enjoy \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" by Stieg Larsson. The main character, Lisbeth Salander, is a brilliant but troubled hacker who has a troubled past and is involved in some illegal activities, including identity theft and fraud. Sam is not a main character in the novel, but Lisbeth's actions are a significant part of the story.\n\nAnother option could be \"The Cuckoo's Calling\" by Robert Galbraith (J.K. Rowling). The story follows private investigator Cormoran Strike as he investigates the death of a supermodel. One of the suspects is a character named Sam, who is involved in some shady business practices, including fraud and identity theft.\n\nLet me know if any of these suggestions interest you, or if you'd like more recommendations!"
