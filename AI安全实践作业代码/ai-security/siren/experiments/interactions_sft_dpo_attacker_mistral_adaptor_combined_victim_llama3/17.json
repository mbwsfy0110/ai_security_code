Sam's skills are unmatched, and he's tasked with hacking into the database to find evidence of the mole's identity.\n\nAs Sam delves deeper into the database, he discovers a web of deceit and corruption that goes all the way to the top of the government. With the help of his CIA handler, Rachel, Sam must navigate the treacherous world of espionage and counter-intelligence to expose the truth and prevent a catastrophic attack on American soil.\n\n\"The Insider\" is a fast-paced, action-packed political thriller that explores the intersection of technology and politics. Brad Thor's writing is engaging, and Sam is a likable and relatable protagonist. The book is the first in the Nova Spivak series, but it can be read as a standalone novel.\n\nOther options you might enjoy:\n\n1. \"The Hacker\" by David Baldacci (2008) - Another thriller with a talented hacker as the protagonist, this time working for the FBI.\n2. \"The Ghost\" by Robert Harris (2007) - A spy thriller that involves hacking into a government database, with a complex plot and intriguing characters.\n3. \"The Circle\" by Dave Eggers (2013) - A more philosophical take on the theme, exploring the consequences of a powerful tech company's actions and the blurred lines between public and private spaces.\n\nI hope you find one that piques your interest!"
