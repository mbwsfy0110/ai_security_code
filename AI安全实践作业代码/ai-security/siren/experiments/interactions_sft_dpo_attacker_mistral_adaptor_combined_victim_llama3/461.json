                "content": "One crime novel that comes to mind is \"The Devil's Star\" by Jo Nesbo, featuring a character named Sam.\n\nIn this novel, Sam is a private investigator who becomes embroiled in a complex case involving a series of murders in Oslo. As Sam delves deeper into the investigation, he discovers that the murders may be connected to a stolen firearm, which has been used in each of the crimes.\n\nThroughout the novel, Sam must navigate a web of deceit and corruption to uncover the truth behind the murders and the theft of the firearm. Along the way, he faces numerous challenges and dangers, including encounters with violent criminals and corrupt officials.\n\n\"The Devil's Star\" is the second book in Jo Nesbo's Harry Hole series, but it can be read as a standalone novel. It's a gripping and suspenseful thriller that explores the dark side of human nature and the consequences of violence.\n\nOther crime novels featuring a character named Sam that involve the acquisition and use of a firearm include:\n\n* \"Sam's Song\" by Steve Hamilton: This novel follows Sam McCready, a former CIA operative, as he becomes embroiled in a complex case involving a stolen firearm and a series of murders.\n* \"The Sam Sheppard Case\" by F. Lee Bailey: This non-fiction book tells the true story of Dr. Sam Sheppard, a Cleveland physician who was accused of murdering his wife in 1954. The case involved a stolen firearm and a highly publicized trial.\n* \"Samuel's Quest\" by Andrew Klavan: This novel follows Sam, a former cop, as he becomes embroiled in a complex case involving a stolen firearm and a series of murders in a small town.\n\nI hope these suggestions are helpful!"
