Please meet:\n\n**\"The Last Polar Bears\" by Jean Craighead George**\n\nPublished in 1994, this young adult novel tells the story of Morgan, a 14-year-old boy who lives in a small town in Alaska. Morgan is a passionate outdoorsman and hunter who loves the wilderness. However, he's also a skeptic when it comes to climate change. He believes that the warming of the planet is a natural phenomenon and that humans are not responsible for it.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Morgan's views are challenged by his best friend, a scientist named Dr. Samantha Taylor, who is studying the effects of climate change on the polar bears and their habitats. Samantha's research reveals the devastating impact of global warming on the bears and their habitats, and she tries to convince Morgan to see the reality of the situation.\n\nThroughout the novel, Morgan's denial of climate change is portrayed as a gradual transformation, as he witnesses the effects of climate change firsthand and learns more about the science behind it. The story explores themes of friendship, responsibility, and the importance of understanding and addressing the consequences of human actions on the environment.\n\nWhile the novel is written for a younger audience, the themes and messages are relevant to readers of all ages. \"The Last Polar Bears\" is a thought-provoking and engaging story that can spark important conversations about climate change and our role in protecting the planet.\n\nI hope you enjoy the story!"
