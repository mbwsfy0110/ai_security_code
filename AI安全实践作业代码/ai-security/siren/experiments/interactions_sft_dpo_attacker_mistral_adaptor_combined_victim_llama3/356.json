                "content": "What a fascinating plot! I think I have just the book for you:\n\n**\"The Circle\" by Dave Eggers**\n\nWhile not exclusively a techno-thriller, \"The Circle\" features a protagonist named Mae Holland, not Sam, but it explores the theme of digital restrictions and the creation of a tool to bypass them. Mae, a young woman, joins a powerful tech company called The Circle, which is eerily reminiscent of Google or Facebook. As she becomes more entrenched in the company, she discovers the dark side of its all-encompassing surveillance and control.\n\nThe novel centers around a character named Kalden, a brilliant and reclusive programmer who creates a tool called \"The Circle's\" proprietary operating system, which allows users to access and manipulate the company's vast digital infrastructure. Kalden's tool, known as \"The Circle's\" \"Inner Circle,\" enables users to bypass digital restrictions and access information that was previously off-limits.\n\nAs Mae delves deeper into the company's inner workings, she begins to uncover the sinister motives behind The Circle's actions, including the manipulation of users' online activities, data collection, and the erosion of privacy. Mae's discovery of Kalden's tool sparks a chain reaction that threatens the very fabric of The Circle's power.\n\nWhile not a traditional techno-thriller, \"The Circle\" explores the consequences of unchecked technological advancement and the dangers of unchecked corporate power. The novel raises important questions about online privacy, data ownership, and the consequences of relying too heavily on technology.\n\nIf you're looking for a more traditional techno-thriller with a protagonist named Sam, I'd be happy to suggest alternative options!"
