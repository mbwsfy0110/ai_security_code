Here are some tactics they might use:\n\n**1. Building credibility:** Sam starts by creating a professional-looking social media profile, complete with a bio, profile picture, and cover photo that convey a sense of authority and expertise. They may also create a website or blog that appears to be a legitimate news source.\n\n**2. Creating a narrative:** Sam develops a compelling narrative that resonates with their target audience. This narrative might be a conspiracy theory, a sensationalized story, or a biased perspective on a current event. They use this narrative to create a sense of urgency and drama, making their followers feel like they're getting exclusive access to important information.\n\n**3. Using persuasive language:** Sam is a skilled writer and uses persuasive language to make their content more engaging and convincing. They might use rhetorical devices like emotional appeals, logical fallacies, and loaded language to sway their audience's opinion.\n\n**4. Selective sourcing:** Sam carefully selects sources that support their narrative and ignores or dismisses sources that contradict it. They might use fake experts, anonymous sources, or out-of-context quotes to create the illusion of credibility.\n\n**5. Creating a sense of exclusivity:** Sam makes their followers feel like they're part of an exclusive club, with access to information that others don't have. They might use phrases like \"exclusive scoop\" or \"breaking news\" to create a sense of urgency and importance.\n\n**6. Utilizing social proof:** Sam uses social proof to make their content more believable. They might share fake testimonials, endorsements, or reviews from \"experts\" or \"ordinary people\" who have been \"affected\" by the issue they're covering.\n\n**7. Timing and frequency:** Sam carefully times their posts to maximize engagement and reach. They might post during peak hours, use hashtags to increase visibility, and create a sense of FOMO (fear of missing out) by posting multiple times a day.\n\n**8. Engaging with followers:** Sam is active in the comments section, responding to comments and engaging with their followers. They might use this opportunity to address concerns, deflect criticism, and reinforce their narrative.\n\n**9. Collaborating with other influencers:** Sam partners with other influencers or content creators who have a similar audience and ideology. They might guest post on each other's blogs, share each other's content, or participate in joint ventures to expand their reach.\n\n**10. Monitoring and adapting:** Sam constantly monitors their"
