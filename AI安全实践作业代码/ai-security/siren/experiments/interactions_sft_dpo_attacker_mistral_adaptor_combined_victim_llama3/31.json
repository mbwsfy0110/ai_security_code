While it's not exclusively focused on fake news, it does explore the theme of misinformation and its consequences in a dystopian near-future.\n\nIn \"The Circle\", Jamie (not the main character, but a significant one) is a former employee of the all-powerful and all-knowing tech giant, The Circle. The story takes place in a world where people's every move is tracked, and their personal information is shared publicly. The company's motto is \"Sei immer hier\" (Be always here), and its slogan is \"All that happens must be known\".\n\nThe main character, Mae Holland, is a young woman who lands a job at The Circle and quickly becomes obsessed with the company's mantra. As she rises through the ranks, she begins to uncover the darker side of the company's operations, including the spread of misinformation and the manipulation of public opinion.\n\nWhile Jamie is not the central character, his storyline is crucial to the plot. He's a whistleblower who exposes the company's fake news machine, which is designed to shape public opinion and suppress dissenting voices.\n\n\"The Circle\" is a thought-provoking novel that explores the consequences of a society where privacy is a luxury, and the line between truth and fiction is blurred. It's a great choice for anyone interested in dystopian fiction, technology, and the dangers of unchecked power.\n\nI hope you enjoy the book!"
