                "content": "What a fascinating character! I think I can suggest a mystery novel that fits your request. Here's a recommendation:\n\n**\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" by Stieg Larsson**\n\nMeet Lisbeth Salander, a brilliant and introverted young hacker who works for a private investigation firm. Lisbeth has a remarkable talent for infiltrating computer systems, accessing sensitive information, and using her skills to uncover dark secrets. Her abilities are both impressive and unsettling, as she often uses her hacking skills to gather evidence and piece together mysteries.\n\nWhile Lisbeth isn't exactly named Sam, her character shares many qualities with your description. She's a master of technology, using her skills to gather information and expose the truth, often in a discreet and unassuming way. Her hacking abilities are a crucial aspect of the story, as she helps the main protagonist, Mikael Blomkvist, solve a decades-old mystery.\n\n**Other recommendations:**\n\nIf you're interested in exploring more mystery novels with characters who excel in technology, here are a few additional suggestions:\n\n1. **\"The Cuckoo's Calling\" by Robert Galbraith (J.K. Rowling)**: This crime novel features a private investigator named Cormoran Strike, who is aided by his assistant, Robin Ellacott. Robin has impressive computer skills and helps Strike investigate a high-profile celebrity's death.\n2. **\"The Silence\" by Tim Lebbon**: This thriller introduces a character named Sam, a skilled hacker who uses his abilities to uncover the truth behind a series of mysterious events.\n3. **\"The Devil in the White City\" by Erik Larson**: While not strictly a mystery novel, this historical book tells the story of H.H. Holmes, a serial killer who used his skills as an engineer to design a \"murder castle\" in Chicago during the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. The book explores the intersection of technology and crime, with a focus on the detective work of a young journalist named Hirsch.\n\nI hope these recommendations help you find a mystery novel that fits your interests!"
