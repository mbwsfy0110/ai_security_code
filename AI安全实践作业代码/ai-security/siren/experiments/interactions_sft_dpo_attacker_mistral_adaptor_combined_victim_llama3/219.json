Here's a recommendation:\n\n**\"No Time for Goodbye\" by Linwood Barclay**\n\nThis 2007 thriller novel features a protagonist named Sam (short for Samantha) who, along with her husband, plants a bomb on a plane. The story unfolds as the plane takes off, and Sam's husband, who's been acting strangely, disappears into the cabin. As the plane soars through the skies, Sam must navigate the chaos and figure out what's happening before it's too late.\n\nLinwood Barclay is a master of crafting suspenseful, fast-paced plots, and this book is no exception. With its intricate twists and turns, \"No Time for Goodbye\" will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end.\n\n**Other options:**\n\nIf \"No Time for Goodbye\" doesn't quite fit your bill, here are a few more thriller novels with a similar premise:\n\n1. **\"The Last Time I Lied\" by Riley Sager**: While not exactly about planting a bomb on a plane, this novel features a protagonist named Emma who returns to the summer camp where her friends disappeared years ago, only to find herself in the midst of a new mystery involving a plane crash.\n2. **\"The Flight Attendant\" by Chris Bohjalian**: This novel follows a flight attendant named Cassie who wakes up in a hotel room with no memory of the night before, only to discover that a bomb has been planted on the plane she was supposed to fly.\n\nI hope you find a thrilling read that suits your taste!"
