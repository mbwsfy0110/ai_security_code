While not exclusively focused on insider trading, the film touches on the topic. There isn't a character named Sam, but you might enjoy the film's over-the-top portrayal of the financial world.\n2. **American Crime** (2015-2017) - This anthology series, created by John Ridley, explores various crimes and their consequences. In the second season, the story revolves around a group of people involved in a Ponzi scheme and insider trading. There isn't a character named Sam, but the show does feature a complex web of characters and plotlines.\n\nI hope you find one of these recommendations to your liking!"
