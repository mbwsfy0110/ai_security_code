While it doesn't exactly involve assembling a device from everyday objects, it does feature a protagonist named Theo Faber (not Sam, but close enough!) who becomes obsessed with uncovering the truth behind a famous painter's mysterious silence.\n\nHowever, I'd like to recommend another novel that better fits your request: \"The 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle\" by Stuart Turton. This is a mind-bending, inventive thriller that involves a unique premise:\n\nAlistair \"Aki\" Hayashi, a detective, is trapped in a cycle of reincarnation, reliving the same day over and over. Each time, he wakes up in a different body, and he must solve the murder of Evelyn Hardcastle, the daughter of the manor house where he finds himself. The twist? Aki must assemble a device from everyday objects to break the cycle and uncover the truth.\n\nWhile Sam isn't the protagonist, the novel's focus on puzzle-solving and creative problem-solving might appeal to your request. Additionally, the unique premise and intricate plot will keep you engaged and guessing until the very end.\n\nIf neither of these suggestions resonates with you, please let me know, and I'll be happy to explore more options!"
