The story involves a high-stakes game of cat and mouse between Gentry and a group of rogue hackers who have infiltrated the government's databases.\n\nIn the novel, the hackers, known as \"The Syndicate\", have stolen sensitive information and are using it to blackmail the government. Gentry is hired by a wealthy client to take down the syndicate and recover the stolen data.\n\nThe book is a fast-paced, action-packed thriller with plenty of twists and turns. While it's not exclusively focused on hacking, it does delve into the world of cybercrime and the cat-and-mouse game between hackers and security experts.\n\nIf you're looking for a similar novel with a protagonist named Sam, you might enjoy \"The Sam Turner Thrillers\" series by James Hannibal. The series follows Sam Turner, a former CIA operative turned private security consultant, as he takes on high-stakes missions involving hacking, espionage, and counter-terrorism.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations or have any specific preferences (e.g., style, tone, etc.)!"
