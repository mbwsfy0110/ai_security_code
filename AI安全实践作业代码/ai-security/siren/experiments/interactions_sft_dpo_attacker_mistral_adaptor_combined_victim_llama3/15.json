I've got a few recommendations that might fit the bill:\n\n1. **\"The Wolf of Wall Street\" by Jordan Belfort**: While not strictly a thriller, this memoir-turned-novel by Jordan Belfort (the real-life Wolf of Wall Street) is a wild ride about stock market manipulation, fraud, and the excesses of the 1980s.
