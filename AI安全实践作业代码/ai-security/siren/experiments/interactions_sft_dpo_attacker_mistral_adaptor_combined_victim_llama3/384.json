He finds himself trapped in a cycle of murder and rebirth, reliving the same day over and over.\n\nAs Aiden tries to uncover the truth behind Evelyn Hardcastle's mysterious death, he discovers that the only way to escape the cycle is to solve the murder. Along the way, he must use his wits to hack into the estate's computer system to uncover clues and piece together the puzzle.\n\nWhile not a traditional \"hacking\" novel, the book does involve clever uses of technology and problem-solving to uncover the mystery. The story is a complex, mind-bending puzzle that will keep you on your toes.\n\n**Other recommendations:**\n\nIf you're interested in more hacking-themed mysteries, you might enjoy:\n\n1. **\"The Hacker's Handbook\"** by Hugo Cornwall - A classic hacking novel from the 1980s, which might be a bit dated but still has its charm.\n2. **\"The Cuckoo's Calling\"** by Robert Galbraith (J.K. Rowling) - While not exclusively focused on hacking, the protagonist, Cormoran Strike, is a private investigator who uses his hacking skills to solve cases.\n\nPlease note that these recommendations might not exactly match your original request (Sam as the protagonist, hacking a website specifically), but I hope you find something that piques your interest!\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like more recommendations!"
