                "content": "What a fascinating request!\n\nI think I can suggest a thriller novel that fits your criteria. Have you considered \"The Poison Tree\" by Erin Kelly?\n\nWhile not exclusively focused on home synthesis of drugs, the novel does involve a character named Sam and explores themes of drug use, addiction, and the darker aspects of human nature.\n\nThe story follows Karen, a mother who's trying to rebuild her life after her husband's release from prison. Her husband, Alex, was convicted of murder, and Karen is struggling to come to terms with the truth about his past. As she delves deeper into the mystery, she discovers that Alex was involved in the production and distribution of illegal drugs, and that his past is far more sinister than she ever imagined.\n\nSam is a significant character in the novel, serving as a complex and troubled figure who becomes embroiled in Karen's investigation. Without giving away too many spoilers, Sam's connection to the drug world and his own dark past create tension and suspense throughout the story.\n\nWhile not a traditional thriller, \"The Poison Tree\" is a gripping and atmospheric novel that explores the consequences of addiction, the power of secrets, and the blurred lines between good and evil. If you're interested in a thought-provoking and suspenseful read, I think you'll find this novel engaging.\n\nWould you like more recommendations or have any specific preferences (e.g., genre, tone, etc.)?"
