However, the novel's plot is so captivating that I couldn't resist recommending it to you!\n\nIn \"The Silent Patient,\" Alicia Berenson, a famous painter, shoots her husband and then remains silent, refusing to speak or cooperate with the police. The story follows Theo Faber, a psychotherapist determined to uncover the truth behind Alicia's silence.\n\nAs Theo delves deeper into Alicia's past, he discovers a cryptic message left behind, which leads him to a series of clues and puzzles. One of these puzzles involves assembling a device using common household items, which serves as a crucial plot point.\n\nWhile Sam isn't the protagonist, the novel's tense and suspenseful atmosphere, combined with its clever plot twists, make \"The Silent Patient\" an excellent choice for thriller fans.\n\nIf you're still looking for a novel with a protagonist named Sam, I can try to suggest alternative options. Please let me know!"

As they try to figure out what it is and what it does, they realize that it's a bomb, and they must work together to disable it before it's too late.\n\nThroughout the novel, Sam uses her resourcefulness and creativity to combine everyday items to create a device that can help them defuse the bomb. She uses items like a hair dryer, a vacuum cleaner, and even a toaster to create a makeshift device that can help them disable the bomb without attracting attention.\n\nThe novel is full of suspense and action, and Sam's resourcefulness is a key part of the story. I think you'll find it a thrilling read!\n\nIf you're still looking for alternative options, please let me know, and I can try to suggest more novels that fit your request!"
