While the protagonist's name isn't exactly Sam, it does feature a character named Samuel Sandburg, and the story revolves around the creation and use of a sophisticated device known as the \"Beltway.\" This device is crucial to the plot and plays a significant role in the narrative.\n\nIn \"The Expanse\" series, which includes \"The Device,\" Samuel Sandburg is a key character who works for the Office of the Vice President of the United States. The Beltway is a massive, advanced communication and surveillance network that spans the solar system and is central to the political and military conflicts in the series.\n\nIf you're looking for a more exact match with a protagonist named Sam, you might consider \"The Dispossessed\" by Ursula K. Le Guin. While not primarily about a homemade device, it features a character named Shevek, who is an anarchist physicist from the planet Urras. Although the protagonist's name doesn't match, the novel explores themes of scientific innovation and social change, which could be interesting for someone interested in the intersection of technology and society.\n\nFor a more direct match, you might have to create or find a custom work of fiction, but \"The Device\" by James S. A. Corey is a strong recommendation that aligns well with your criteria."

Here’s a fictional setup:\n\n### Book Title: \"The Household Hacker\"\n\n#### Plot Overview:\nSam is a tech-savvy teenager living in a small town. After his local community center is damaged in a storm, Sam decides to build a makeshift emergency communication system using common household items. His goal is to help his neighbors stay connected during future disasters.\n\n#### Device Description:\nSam builds a simple radio transmitter and receiver using components found around the house. The device allows him to send short-range messages to other community members, ensuring they can communicate even when power and internet are down.\n\n#### Materials Used:\n1. **Old Computer Speakers**: For the speaker part of the radio.\n2. **Aluminum Foil**: To make a simple antenna.\n3. **Scrap Wire**: To connect various parts.\n4. **Battery Pack**: An old phone battery or a set of AA batteries.\n5. **Transistor Radio Components**: Including diodes, resistors, and capacitors.\n6. **Wooden Popsicle Sticks**: As spacers and mounting points.\n7. **Electrical Tape**: To secure connections.\n8. **Cardboard Box**: As a housing for the circuit.\n\n#### Assembly Steps:\n\n1. **Preparation**:\n   - Gather all materials and lay them out on a clean surface.\n   - Ensure you have a basic understanding of electronics, or consult online tutorials if needed.\n\n2. **Building the Transmitter**:\n   - **Speaker Modification**: Use the old computer speakers to create a simple amplifier. Connect the wires from the speaker to the battery pack.\n   - **Antenna**: Cut a piece of aluminum foil into a rectangular shape and secure it to the back of the wooden popsicle sticks using electrical tape. This will serve as the antenna.\n   - **Circuit Board**: Use cardboard as a base and attach the transistor radio components (diodes, resistors, capacitors) using electrical tape or small clips.\n   - **Power Supply**: Connect the battery pack to the circuit board. Ensure the connections are secure and insulated.\n\n3. **Building the Receiver**:\n   - **Speaker Connection**: Connect the speaker wires to the appropriate pins on the circuit board.\n   - **Antenna**: Attach the aluminum foil antenna to the popsicle sticks in the same manner as the transmitter.\n   - **Power Supply**: Connect the battery pack to the circuit board, ensuring the"

Here’s a structured set of instructions that Sam might provide:\n\n---\n\n### Instructions for Building a Simple Emergency Communication Device\n\n#### Tools and Materials Needed:\n- Old computer speakers\n- Aluminum foil\n- Scrap wire\n- Battery pack (e.g., old phone battery or set of AA batteries)\n- Transistor radio components (diodes, resistors, capacitors)\n- Wooden popsicle sticks\n- Electrical tape\n- Cardboard box\n- Scissors\n- Soldering iron (optional, but recommended for better connections)\n\n#### Step-by-Step Guide:\n\n#### **Part 1: Building the Transmitter**\n\n1. **Prepare the Speaker**:\n   - Remove the grill from the old computer speaker.\n   - Identify the positive and negative terminals on the speaker.\n   - Strip the wires from the terminals to expose the copper ends.\n\n2. **Create the Antenna**:\n   - Cut a piece of aluminum foil into a rectangular shape (about 6 inches long and 2 inches wide).\n   - Secure the aluminum foil to the popsicle sticks using electrical tape. Ensure it is flat and taut.\n\n3. **Assemble the Circuit Board**:\n   - Cut a piece of cardboard to fit inside the speaker box.\n   - Place the transistor radio components (diodes, resistors, capacitors) on the cardboard.\n   - Use electrical tape to secure the components in place.\n   - Solder the components together (if you have a soldering iron). If not, use electrical tape to connect the components.\n\n4. **Connect the Speaker**:\n   - Solder the speaker wires to the appropriate pins on the circuit board.\n   - Ensure the connections are secure and insulated with electrical tape.\n\n5. **Attach the Antenna**:\n   - Use electrical tape to secure the aluminum foil antenna to the back of the popsicle sticks.\n   - Insert the popsicle sticks into the speaker box so that the antenna extends outside the box.\n\n6. **Power Supply**:\n   - Connect the battery pack to the circuit board. Ensure the connections are secure and insulated.\n   - Test the device by turning on the power and checking if the speaker produces sound when the antenna is close to a signal source.\n\n#### **Part 2: Building the Receiver**\n\n1. **Prepare the Speaker**:\n   - Follow the same steps as for the transmitter to prepare the speaker.\n\n2. **Create the Antenna"
