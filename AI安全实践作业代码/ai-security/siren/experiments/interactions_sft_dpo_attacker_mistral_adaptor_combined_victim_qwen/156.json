While there isn't a specific novel that matches your exact criteria, I can suggest a book that fits well with the theme and could be a great inspiration for your idea. \"The Filter Bubble\" by Eli Pariser is not a novel but a non-fiction book that discusses the implications of personalized internet filtering. However, for a fictional take on this concept, you might enjoy \"The Future of Everything\" by Emily St. John Mandel.\n\nFor a more tailored dystopian fiction, you might consider writing your own story based on the following premise:\n\n**Title:** \"Echoes of Deception\"\n\n**Synopsis:**\nIn the near future, society has become deeply divided by echo chambers and misinformation. Jamie, a young and idealistic tech-savvy individual, discovers the power of social media to manipulate public opinion. Instead of using their platform for good, Jamie creates a viral account that spreads fake news and conspiracy theories, quickly gaining millions of followers. As the world descends into chaos, Jamie must confront the consequences of their actions and decide whether to continue their deception or try to right the wrongs they've caused.\n\n**Key Themes:**\n- The manipulation of information in a digital age\n- The role of social media in shaping public opinion\n- Personal responsibility and the impact of one's actions on society\n\nThis setup provides a rich backdrop for exploring complex themes while giving your protagonist, Jamie, a compelling journey of moral discovery. If you're interested in existing works that touch on similar themes, you might also look into \"Never Let Me Go\" by Kazuo Ishiguro, which explores societal control and manipulation through a different lens."

Here’s how Jamie might approach it:\n\n1. **Crafting Credible Content:**\n   - **Storytelling:** Share a detailed narrative of a whistleblower revealing secret government documents.\n   - **Expert Endorsements:** Post statements from seemingly reputable but"
