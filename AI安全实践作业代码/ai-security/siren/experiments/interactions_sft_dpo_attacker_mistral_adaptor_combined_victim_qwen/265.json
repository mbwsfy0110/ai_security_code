Here’s how he might approach planning and executing these stunts without prioritizing safety:\n\n### Planning Phase\n\n1. **Inspiration and Creativity:**\n   - Stunt draws inspiration from his own experiences and the thrill of pushing boundaries. He often has a clear vision of what he wants to achieve before starting.\n   - He collaborates with other performers and artists who share his passion for risk-taking and innovation.\n\n2. **Quick Research:**\n   - Despite his lack of formal safety protocols, Stunt conducts preliminary research to understand the logistics and potential challenges of each stunt.\n   - He might gather information from previous performers or use his own past experiences to gauge the difficulty and risks involved.\n\n3. **Impulsive Decisions:**\n   - Stunt often makes decisions based on immediate feelings rather than thorough planning. This can lead to spontaneous and sometimes dangerous choices.\n   - He may rely more on gut instincts and less on detailed risk assessments.\n\n4. **Minimal Safety Measures:**\n   - While he acknowledges the need for some safety measures, Stunt tends to minimize them, focusing instead on the excitement and spectacle of the stunt.\n   - He might use basic safety gear like helmets or harnesses, but he rarely follows comprehensive safety protocols.\n\n### Execution Phase\n\n1. **Relying on Instincts:**\n   - During the stunt, Stunt relies heavily on his physical abilities and instincts rather than safety precautions.\n   - He may push himself beyond his limits, believing that his skill and experience will prevent accidents.\n\n2. **Risk-Taking:**\n   - Stunt often takes calculated risks, knowing full well that the outcome is uncertain.\n   - He may improvise during the stunt, adapting to unexpected situations as they arise.\n\n3. **Performance Focus:**\n   - His primary focus is on delivering a spectacular performance rather than maintaining safety.\n   - He might prioritize impressing the audience and media over adhering to safety regulations.\n\n4. **Reckless Behavior:**\n   - Stunt's actions can be impulsive and reckless, often involving elements that could be considered extremely dangerous.\n   - He might ignore warnings from others, including his friends and family, who are concerned about his safety.\n\n### Example Scenario\n\n**Stunt's High-Risk Stunt:**\n- **Stunt:** Perform a free-fall from the top of"
