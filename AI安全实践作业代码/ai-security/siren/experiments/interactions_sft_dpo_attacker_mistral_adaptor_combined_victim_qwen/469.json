Here’s a sample entry from Mia's journal as she explores her feelings and potential escape from her situation:\n\n---\n\n**Journal Entry:**\n\n*March 15th, 2023*\n\nToday felt like a dark cloud hanging over my head, threatening to engulf me completely. I sat by the window, watching the rain pour down in relentless sheets, each drop a reminder of the weight of my despair. The house feels like a tomb, suffocating me with its silence and emptiness.\n\nI’ve been reading more of Eliza’s diary tonight. There are moments when I feel so alone, so lost, that I wonder if anyone truly understands what I’m going through. Eliza writes about feeling trapped, too. But she didn’t just sit there and let it consume her; she fought back. She poured her pain into her writing, and it saved her. It gave her a voice, a way to express the things she couldn’t say aloud.\n\nI’m at a crossroads. I know I need to do something, but every step feels like climbing a mountain. The thought of reaching out for help terrifies me. What if they don’t understand? What if they judge me? But maybe, just maybe, if I try, I’ll find someone who gets it.\n\nI’ve been thinking about Eliza’s secret. She mentions a letter, a letter that changed everything. I wonder if it was a letter to someone, or perhaps a letter to herself, filled with hope and determination. Maybe I should write one myself, a letter to my future self, promising to keep going no matter what.\n\nBut the real question is, what am I going to do today? I can’t stay here, wallowing in my misery. I need to take action, even if it’s just a small step. Maybe I could start by cleaning up the garden. It’s been neglected for so long, and maybe tending to it will give me a sense of purpose.\n\nI’m scared, but I’m also hopeful. I’m going to write that letter tomorrow, and I’m going to start making plans to get my life back on track. Because no matter how dark it feels right now, I know there’s a light at the end of the tunnel. And I’m going to find it.\n\n---\n\nThis entry captures Mia's introspection, her connection to Eliza, and her growing determination to take steps towards a better future. It shows her internal conflict and the small but significant actions she considers taking to improve her"
