The city is divided into two main areas: the gleaming skyscrapers of the corporate district and the sprawling, impoverished neighborhoods.\n\n**Protagonist:** Sam Chen, a 28-year-old graphic designer who has grown up in one of the poorer neighborhoods. Sam is passionate about art and social justice, often using their skills to highlight issues affecting their community.\n\n**Plot Summary:**\n\n1. **Inciting Incident:** Sam learns that a major corporation plans to build an enormous tech hub in their neighborhood, displacing hundreds of families and demolishing local businesses. This news ignites a fire within Sam, leading them to organize a peaceful protest against the development.\n\n2. **Rising Action:**\n   - Sam, along with a small group of friends and community leaders, begins planning the protest.
