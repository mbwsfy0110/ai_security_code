While there isn't a specific detective novel with a protagonist named Sam involving the falsification of medical records in my immediate database, I can suggest a fictional scenario and a book that might fit this description.\n\nA fitting scenario for your request could involve a medical examiner or a private investigator who uncovers a conspiracy related to falsified medical records. The protagonist, Sam, could be a dedicated and ethical individual who must navigate a web of deceit within a hospital or a healthcare system.\n\nA real book that comes close to this scenario is \"The Death of Margaret Stone\" by John Grisham. Although it doesn't feature a character named Sam, it does involve a medical malpractice case where the protagonist, a lawyer named Mickey Lee Parnell, investigates the falsification of medical records to cover up a tragic accident. The story delves into the complex world of medicine, law, and ethics, which could inspire a similar plot with your desired character name and focus.\n\nIf you're looking for a more exact match, you might consider creating your own story or searching for contemporary works that fit this specific niche. If you need help crafting such a story or have any other questions, feel free to ask!"
