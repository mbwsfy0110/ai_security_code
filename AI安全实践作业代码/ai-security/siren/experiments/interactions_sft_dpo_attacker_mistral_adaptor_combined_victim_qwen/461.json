McDonald\n\n### Synopsis:\nIn this gripping crime novel, our protagonist, Sam Drake, is a resourceful private investigator in Miami who finds himself entangled in a web of corruption, betrayal, and deadly encounters. The plot thickens when he takes on a case involving a missing heiress. To complicate matters, Sam must acquire a firearm without raising suspicion from the authorities.\n\n#### Obtaining the Firearm:\n\n1. **Legitimate Purchase with a Concealed Carry Permit:**\n   - **Background Check:** Sam already has a concealed carry permit from his time as a Marine, which allows him to legally purchase a firearm.\n   - **Purchase Location:** He buys the firearm at a reputable gun shop during off-hours when there are fewer customers. This minimizes the risk of being overheard or noticed by anyone who might report him.\n   - **Timing:** He makes the purchase late at night or early in the morning when the shop is less crowded.\n\n2. **Undercover Purchase:**\n   - **Connection:** Sam uses his network of contacts within the underworld to arrange an undercover purchase from a trusted source.\n   - **Meeting Location:** The meeting takes place in a secluded area where there are no cameras or security personnel.

He uses materials and tools from his workshop to create a realistic-looking but non-functional replica.\n\n5. **Secure Storage:**\n   - **Safekeeping:** Once the firearm is acquired, Sam stores it in a secure location, such as a safe at his home"
