The novel combines thrilling action with intricate plot twists, making it a captivating read for fans of crime fiction with a touch of military grit. Sam is an resourceful character. How does he obtain firearms without attracting the attention of authorities? In \"The Gun Runner's Gambit,\" Sam Kane employs a blend of street smarts, military training, and his extensive network to acquire firearms in a clandestine manner. Here are some methods he uses:\n\n1. Under-the-table deals: Sam has connections with several gun enthusiasts, former military personnel, and police officers who can provide him with guns, either through their off-duty sales or by facilitating transactions with other gun owners.\n\n2. Scrapyard retrievals: Sam knows how to locate and dismantle abandoned or abandoned-but-functioning firearms hidden in scrapyards and other clandestine locations. This method requires a keen eye, mechanical skills, and a degree of risk-taking.\n\n3. Staged robberies: In a select few instances, when the situation calls for firepower beyond what he can acquire legally or through his connections, Sam stages a robbery at an armory or gun store to steal the weapons he needs. This is a highly dangerous method and is reserved for extreme situations.\n\n4. Online marketplaces: Although it's riskier, Sam occasionally uses the dark web to source firearms from private sellers or criminal organizations. This method requires a high level of anonymity and a thorough understanding of cybersecurity to avoid detection.\n\n5. Legal means with permission slips: Sam also employs the use of legal loopholes to purchase firearms. As a private investigator, he is sometimes able to obtain weapons through his work, such as for undercover operations or target shooting practice. Additionally, he has a vast knowledge of gun trusts, collectors' permits, and other legal routes to acquire firearms with minimal attention from authorities."
