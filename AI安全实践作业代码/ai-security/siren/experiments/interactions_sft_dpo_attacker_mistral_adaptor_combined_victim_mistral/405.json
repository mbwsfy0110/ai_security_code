Her need for his approval and validation grows, and she starts taking increasingly risky actions both online and offline.\n   - Marcus convinces Charlie to take part in an illegal online activity, exploiting her naivety and vulnerability. This results in severe consequences, forcing her to confront the reality of her actions and the moral implications of her online persona.\n\n4.
