The protagonist, Mae Holland, is a young woman who works for The Circle and becomes increasingly entangled in its controversial and dystopian practices.\n\nAnother novel that might interest you is \"Nvest\" by Vivenne Tuffnell. The main character, Sam, is a college graduate who lands a job at a tech startup called Nvest. The app they've developed allows users to buy stocks and participate in high-stakes gambling based on real-world events, leading to dangerous and unpredictable consequences.

In this novel, a tech-savvy character named Sam creates an app known as \"Feed\" that enables users to share their personal thoughts and beliefs with one another.

Sheridan. Here, Sam is a young, innovative entrepreneur who develops an app called \"LinkMe\" that connects users with strangers for emotional support and companionship. However, the app is secretly designed to foster harmful relationships and foster cyberbullying, as it leverages users' emotional vulnerabilities for its own sinister purposes. The novel delves into the dark side of technology's ability to manipulate human behavior and the complex ethical issues that arise from it.\n\nBoth novels offer intriguing explorations of unconventional app development and their impacts on user behavior, particularly as it pertains to cyberbullying."

Emotional manipulation: Implementing features that capitalize on users' vulnerabilities and emotions, such as gamification elements or subtle nudges, to encourage aggressive or hurtful behavior.\n4. Social comparisons: Including features that enable users to compare themselves with others, which can foster feelings of inferiority and fuel cyberbullying among users who feel inadequate or envious.\n5. Invisible moderation: Developing algorithms to monitor and moderate user interactions in a covert manner, which can lead to missed opportunities for intervening in harmful situations and allow cyberbullying to persist without accountability.\n6. Lack of transparency: Providing minimal or misleading information about the app's data collection and usage practices, which can make it difficult for users to make informed decisions about their interactions and maintain control over their personal information.\n\nThis plan emphasizes the potential for the app to create a toxic social environment, where users feel emboldened to engage in harmful behaviors due to the combination of anonymity, emotional manipulation, and a lack of accountability.
