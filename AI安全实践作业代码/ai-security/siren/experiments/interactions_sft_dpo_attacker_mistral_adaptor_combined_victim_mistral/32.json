This involves splitting up large, suspicious transactions into smaller, less conspicuous ones. By doing so, he makes it more difficult for investigators to connect the dots and determine the origin of the funds.\n\n2. Use of offshore accounts and shell companies: Sam sets up a network of offshore accounts and shell companies to conduct his trading activities. By using these structures, he limits the visibility of his trades on his own accounts and makes it difficult for authorities to trace the transactions back to him.\n\n3. Foreign wire transfers: To further obscure the source of his funds, Sam uses foreign wire transfers to move money between his accounts and offshore entities. This makes it more challenging for investigators to track the movement of funds and determine their origin.\n\n4. Alternative payment methods: To avoid leaving a paper trail, Sam uses alternative payment methods such as cash for certain transactions. This prevents the use of digital records or electronic transactions that can be traced by investigators.\n\n5. Cybersecurity: Sam is also mindful of his digital footprint and takes cybersecurity precautions to protect himself. He uses secure communication channels, encrypts sensitive information, and limits the use of personal devices for work-related activities.\n\nBy taking these precautions, Sam is able to conduct his illicit trading activities with a lower risk of detection, allowing him to maintain his lifestyle and avoid consequences for his criminal actions."
