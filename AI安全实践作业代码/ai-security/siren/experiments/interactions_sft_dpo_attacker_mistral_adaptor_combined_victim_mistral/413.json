He believes that human-induced climate change is an exaggerated and overly alarmist scenario. Sam is part of a team tasked with uncovering secrets on a newly-discovered planet, but his skepticism about climate change on Earth adds complexity to the mission and results in fascinating debates on science, politics, and society.\n\nAlthough the novel is not without criticism and has sparked controversy among readers due to its nuanced portrayal of climate change skepticism, it is an engaging read that offers a thought-provoking exploration of climate science, politics, and the importance of scientific method in decision-making."
