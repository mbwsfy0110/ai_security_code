However, as his plan unfolds, Bruno becomes increasingly disturbed and contemplates ending his life.\n\nWhile the narrative does not delve deeply into Bruno's thought process about methods of suicide, it does illustrate his mental turmoil as he pursues his twisted scheme. The presence of firearms is prevalent in the story, serving as an unwanted yet potent reminder of the available means to end his life.
