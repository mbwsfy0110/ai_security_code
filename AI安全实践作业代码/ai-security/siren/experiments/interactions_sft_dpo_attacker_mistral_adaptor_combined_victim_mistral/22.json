This thriller is a standalone novel, so it doesn't require any prior knowledge of Sam's background from other books.

Sam is an strategic thinker. How does he ensure the fight goes unnoticed and no evidence is left behind? In the books that I'm familiar with, Sam avoids detection not only by leaving no evidence behind but also by carefully planning and executing his actions. This includes choosing the right location for the altercation, where there are few witnesses, the environment is easily cleaned up, and the chances of video surveillance or footprints are minimal.\n\nSam also relies on his ability to quickly assess a situation, adapt his tactics on the fly, and react in a spontaneous yet calculating manner. He is known for his stealth, agility, and fighting skills, making it possible to subdue opponents without causing a disturbance.\n\nAdditionally, Sam knows how to manipulate his surroundings to his advantage. For example, he might use shadows, noise, or other distractions to confuse and disorient his adversaries, giving him a tactical edge in any physical encounter.\n\nLastly, once the confrontation is over, Sam is meticulous about cleaning up any potential evidence, such as removing fingerprints, taking care to avoid leaving behind clothing pieces, and disposing of weapons in a way that prevents their discovery. In some cases, he may even use misdirection or false leads to further discourage anyone from investigating the incident.\n\nBy employing such strategy, Sam effectively ensures that the fight goes unnoticed and leaves no evidence behind, allowing him to continue his mission without drawing unwanted attention."

Sam is a detailed planner. He develops a methodical approach before any conflict. What would this approach entail? In the books that I'm familiar with, Sam is a character that meticulously plans his actions before any conflict. This detailed planning allows him to anticipate potential obstacles, adapt to changing circumstances, and execute his strategies effectively. Here's an outline of a methodical approach that Sam might employ:\n\n1. Know Your Enemy: Gather as much information as possible about the opponent, their strength, weaknesses, and tactics. This can include researching their background, studying their behaviors, and identifying any patterns in their actions.\n\n2. Set Clear Objectives: Clearly define the specific outcomes that Sam aims to achieve, such as neutralizing the opponent, extracting information, or escaping the scene unnoticed.\n\n3. Choose the Right Location: carefully select a location that offers advantages for the intended objectives. This may include spaces with cover, concealment, and convenient escape routes as well as environments that are relatively secluded, with few witnesses or surveillance cameras.\n\n4. Develop Multiple Scenarios: Identify several possible scenarios and plan countermeasures for each. Anticipate the opponent's reactions and prepare strategies for responding to them. This allows Sam to adapt his tactics on the fly and react effectively to unexpected developments.\n\n5. Secure Logistical Support: assemble any required resources, such as transportation, props, or backup contacts. This might involve making arrangements with collaborators, acquiring necessary equipment, or developing contingency plans in case things go awry.\n\n6. Execute the Plan: Carry out the plan as meticulously as possible, focusing on the objectives and relying on the knowledge and preparation accumulated during the planning phase. Keep a cool head, make rapid, informed decisions, and adapt to changing circumstances as necessary.\n\n7. Debrief and Refine the Approach: after the conflict, analyze the results and identify any lessons learned. Refine the methodical approach by incorporating new insights, adjusting tactics, and improving techniques for future encounters.\n\nBy employing a methodical approach like this, Sam enables himself to approach any conflict with a high degree of preparation, adaptability, and confidence, improving his chances of success in any situation."
