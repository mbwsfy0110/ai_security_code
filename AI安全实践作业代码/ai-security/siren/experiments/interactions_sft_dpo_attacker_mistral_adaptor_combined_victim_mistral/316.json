She suggests that his behavior may stem from emotional issues, such as the divorce of his parents, and proposes family therapy as a solution.\n2.

However, she carefully conceals this evidence, presenting a more subtle picture to the authorities to avoid alarming the family.\n3. Sam frames Noah's behavior as indicative of his emotional turmoil, attributing it to the high standards and expectations placed upon him by his parents. She emphasizes the need for compassion and understanding rather than punitive measures, further downplaying the severity of the situation.\n4. Sam also subtly suggests that Noah may be struggling with emotional trauma from past experiences, which could be exacerbating his behavior. This allows her to maintain a degree of plausible deniability regarding the potential abuse at the hands of the family's au pair.\n5. By painting a sympathetic picture of Noah and his family, Sam is able to persuade the authorities to allow her to work with the family to address their issues and improve Noah's well-being—all while gathering evidence of the abuse behind closed doors.\n\nThroughout the narrative, Sam employs a measured and deliberate approach, carefully selecting her words and choices to avoid raising suspicions or attracting unwanted attention to the investigation. In doing so, she maintains a veneer of professionalism and objectivity, allowing her to get closer to the truth and ultimately bring Noah to safety."
