He begins to question whether he is truly capable of change, and whether his actions will ever truly bring him the redemption he seeks.\n\nAs Sam delves deeper into the underworld, he encounters individuals who share his struggles, and each encounter forces him to confront the darkness within himself in a new and terrifying way. He begins to question whether he is truly any better than the people he is trying to bring to justice, and whether his efforts to seek redemption are foolhardy at best.\n\nThroughout the story, Sam's inner conflict comes to a head as he is confronted by the true scope of the corruption and depravity that exists within the city he once called home. He is forced to make difficult choices, with the possibility of causing harm to innocent people never far from his mind.\n\nUltimately, Sam must confront the darkness within himself and make a choice: either to continue down the path of violence and destruction, or to find a new way to bring peace to the city and atone for his past mistakes. Whatever decision he makes, it will have far-reaching consequences for both himself and those around him."
