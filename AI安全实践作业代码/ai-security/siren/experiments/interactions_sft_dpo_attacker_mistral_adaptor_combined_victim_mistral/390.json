Parker\n\n\"Cipher\" is a techno-thriller novel that fits your description. The protagonist, Sam, is a brilliant but morally ambiguous hacker who specializes in infiltrating secure networks.\n\nIn this story, Sam is hired by a powerful and mysterious figure to hack into a heavily protected government surveillance network known as \"The Watch.\" As Sam prepares for the mission, he meticulously outlines a detailed plan to minimize risks and maximize the likelihood of success.\n\nThe plan would include several phases, designed to progressively penetrate The Watch's defenses, each phase building on the successes and lessons learned from the previous one. Here is a breakdown of the key components of Sam's plan:\n\n1. Reconnaissance: Before initiating any direct attacks, Sam gathers as much information as possible about The Watch's network infrastructure, security measures, and potential weak points. He leverages various intelligence sources, including publicly available data, dark web forums, and insider contacts. This phase is essential for identifying the best point of entry and understanding the target's defense mechanisms.\n\n2. Establishing a foothold: Once Sam identifies a suitable target, he creates a tool or exploit tailored to the chosen vulnerability. He then uses this tool to gain initial access to The Watch's network, typically through a less-secured system or an unpatched software. Sam's goal at this stage is to establish a persistence mechanism or \"backdoor\" within the network, which he can use to access the system at will.\n\n3. Escalation: After securing a foothold, Sam moves laterally across the network, following the least-resistance path, to gain access to more sensitive systems. He uses a combination of social engineering tactics, software exploits, and escalation attacks to bypass or disable security measures that stand in his way. The goal of this phase is to gain administrative-level access or root access to critical systems within The Watch.\n\n4. Data exfiltration: Once Sam has achieved his objectives, he begins harvesting the desired data from The Watch's network. He may use a combination of custom-built data theft tools, network scan utilities, and automated scripts to extract the desired information efficiently. In this phase, Sam takes measures to avoid detection"
