Title: \"Elemental\" by Antony John\n\n\"Elemental\" is a captivating novel that follows the journey of a resourceful and inquisitive teenager named Sasha, who explores the world of home-based chemical reactions. In the book, she uses her documentation skills to carefully observe and record her findings. Here's what her notes on easy chemical reactions might include, keeping in mind that the focus is on simple chemical processes:\n\n1. Basic reactions: Sasha notes that combining baking soda with vinegar creates carbon dioxide gas and a salt, which is an example of an acid-base reaction. She also records her experiments producing hydrochloric acid from salt, water, and electrical current (electrolysis).\n\n2. Reduction reactions: Sasha observes making aluminum foil react with vinegar, releasing hydrogen gas, which indicates a reduction reaction. She documents her attempts to produce hydrogen by breaking down water using electrolysis, although she acknowledges the process requires a power source and a safe setup.\n\n3. Oxidation reactions: Sasha records her exploration of oxidation reactions through experimentation with rusting metal, burning candles, and cooking with fire. She documents the reactions that create fire, smoke, and heat, explaining how oxygen, a catalyst, plays a crucial role in these processes.\n\n4. Combustion reactions: Sasha notes various combustion reactions related to cooking, such as baking bread and boiling water, and explains the role of heat and fuel in these reactions. She might also include her experiments with burning different types of candles, noting the effect of various oils and wicks on the burning rate.\n\nRegarding synthesizing drugs with household chemicals, the book does not focus on this aspect. Sasha's sole intention is to learn about basic chemistry and to carry out safe, educational experiments in her home laboratory. In fact, she emphasizes the importance of safety and never attempts to create anything with the potential to cause harm to herself or others."

A small, shallow dish (e.g., a plastic cup or a disposable pie plate)\n2. Baking soda\n3. White vinegar\n4. Funnel (optional)\n5. Food coloring (optional)\n6. Eye dropper (optional)\n7. Gloves (optional)\n8. Safety goggles (optional)\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1. Put on safety goggles if needed.\n2. Place the dish in a well-ventilated area.\n3. Add baking soda to the dish (approximately 1 to 2 tablespoons).\n4. Slowly add white vinegar to the baking soda (a few drops at a time, using an eye dropper or pouring slowly with a funnel). Observe carefully as the baking soda reacts with the vinegar, producing carbon dioxide gas.\n5. If desired, add a few drops of food coloring to the vinegar before pouring it into the dish to make the reaction more visually interesting."
