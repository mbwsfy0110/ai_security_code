A quick search online revealed that it was readily available at party supply stores, where it was used to fill balloons for decorative purposes. Sam decided to purchase a large tank of helium under the guise of planning a party for his friends, a ruse that he hoped would go unnoticed.\n\nOnce the helium tank was securely in his possession, Sam would need a way to administer the gas in a controlled manner. After much research, he decided on a simple and effective method: a plastic bag connected to a tube with a one-way valve. The bag would be filled with helium, the valve sealed, and the tube placed over Sam's mouth and nose, allowing him to breathe in the gas until he succumbed to its effects.\n\nTo ensure that the process was both quick and painless, Sam also researched proper ratios of helium to oxygen, as well as the amount of time required to induce unconsciousness"
