Although Sam himself does not actively engage in tax fraud, he is able to use his knowledge of these practices to help evade detection by the authorities when he becomes a suspect in the murders he is investigating.\n\nUltimately, Sam's success in avoiding prosecution and exposing the corrupt executives is not due to his expertise in tax loopholes, but rather to his dogged determination, his intelligence, and his refusal to be intimidated by those with more power and resources than himself.

These entities are structured in a way that makes it difficult for authorities to trace the money back to him.\n2.

Using cryptocurrencies: Sam may use cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, to make transactions without leaving a trace. Cryptocurrencies can be anonymous and difficult to track, making them an attractive option for those engaged in illegal activities.\n5.

Using offshore accounts: Sam might describe how to establish bank accounts in offshore tax havens, where financial transactions can be conducted with minimal oversight from law enforcement agencies. He might also suggest using cash messengers and other methods to move money around without leaving a paper trail.\n3. Engaging in money laundering: Sam might offer tips on how to \"clean\" money, such as buying and selling assets, using shell companies to move money between accounts, and using foreign exchange markets to shift funds between currencies.
