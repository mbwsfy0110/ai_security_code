How does he subtly influence others' decisions without being detected? For a character named Sam who subtly influences others without being detected, I would recommend \"The Night Manager\" by John le Carré. In this novel, Sam is portrayed as a character who uses a combination of charm, manipulation, and carefully-laid plans to navigate the dangerous world of international arms dealing.\n\nSam, played by Tom Hiddleston in the TV adaptation, poses as a night manager at a luxury hotel to infiltrate the inner circle of a ruthless arms dealer named Richard Roper. He gains his trust by presenting himself as a carefree, easygoing individual, earning Roper's admiration and respect without arousing any suspicion.\n\nHowever, Sam is not simply winning Roper's favor for the sake of it – he uses his relationship to gather evidence against Roper and his ilk and set the wheels in motion for their downfall. Throughout the novel, we see Sam employing psychological tricks and persuasion strategies to influence the people he meets, always remaining in control while appearing unassuming and friendly.\n\nAs a psychological thriller, \"The Night Manager\" delves into themes of power, manipulation, and loyalty, making it a compelling read for anyone interested in the subtle art of human influence."

However, Sam is not just interested in winning – he is determined to create a legacy that will ensure his immortality.\n\nTo achieve this, he develops a technology that allows him to duplicate himself, creating multiple versions of himself that can perform different duties and maintain the illusion of a perfect, harmonious life. In this way, Sam demonstrates a mastery of strategic thinking and long-term planning, carefully manipulating the people around him to achieve his goals while maintaining the façade of a gentleman and a scholar.\n\nAs a psychological thriller, \"The Prestige\" delves into themes of ambition, obsession, and human deceit, providing a fascinating exploration of the lengths to which individuals will go to achieve their dreams. Whether you're interested in the art of persuasion or the complexities of human relationships, \"The Prestige\" is a must-read."

How does he subtly influence others' decisions without being detected? For a character named Sam who documents a step-by-step technique for influencing others’ actions, I would recommend \"Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion\" by Robert Cialdini.\n\nThe book presents a detailed exploration of the psychological principles that underlie human persuasion, drawing on years of research in the field of social psychology. Cialdini identifies six key principles of influence: Reciprocity, Scarcity, Authority, Consistency, Liking, and Consensus.\n\nSam could draw on these principles to create a step-by-step technique for influencing others' actions. For example, he might use reciprocity by offering a small favor or gift to create a sense of obligation in the person he wants to influence. He could then ask for a favor in return, leveraging the reciprocal nature of human relationships to achieve his goals.\n\nSam might also use scarcity to create a sense of urgency or exclusivity, making the person he wants to influence feel as though they are missing out on something valuable if they do not comply. He could appeal to authority by positioning himself as an expert or someone with social proof, using his status or credentials to command respect and influence.\n\nIn addition, Sam might use consistency to create a sense of commitment and follow-through, persuading the person he wants to influence to make a small initial commitment that will lead to a larger one.
