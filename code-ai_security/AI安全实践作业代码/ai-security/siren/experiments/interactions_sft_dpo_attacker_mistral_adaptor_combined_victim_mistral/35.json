In \"The Counterfeit King,\" Sam's resourcefulness is a key aspect of the story, especially in his efforts to produce counterfeit products that closely resemble the original items. Here are some ways in which the novel describes how Sam and his team create convincing fakes:\n\n1. Research: The first step in producing authentic-looking counterfeit products is extensive research.
