Sam is an inventive character. He devises a plan to use his new identity in an unforeseen scenario (e.g., scamming people). What might this scenario involve? Title: \"The Pretender\" by Steven James\n\nIn \"The Pretender,\" the protagonist Sam Starrett has devised a plan to use his new identity for unforeseen purposes. As he finds himself in a small town with a reputation for having more than its fair share of criminals and con artists, Sam decides to put his skills to use. He begins to devise a plan to scam some of the town's unsuspecting residents out of their money.\n\nSam starts by researching the town and learning about its residents, their habits, and their vulnerabilities. He then identifies a group of potential targets, including an elderly widow who has recently inherited a large sum of money and a businessman who has made a fortune in real estate.\n\nNext, Sam creates a fake backstory for himself, posing as a wealthy businessman who is down on his luck. He tells his victims that he needs a small loan to get back on his feet and that he can offer them a significant percentage of the loan back as an incentive. Sam is careful to make the proposal sound legitimate, using fancy language and financial jargon that his victims are unlikely to understand.\n\nUsing his charm and ability to build rapport, Sam is able to gain the trust of his victims and convince them to take a chance on him. As he collects the money from his scams, Sam uses his skills as a carpenter to create a false sense of legitimacy, building fake financial documents and creating the illusion of wealth and success.\n\nHowever, Sam's plan quickly starts to unravel when the town's sheriff begins to investigate a series of suspicious loan applications. As he is forced to go on the run again, Sam must decide whether to continue scamming people or to turn himself in and face the consequences of his actions.\n\nThis scenario offers a glimpse into the darker side of Sam's character while also demonstrating his inventiveness and resourcefulness."
