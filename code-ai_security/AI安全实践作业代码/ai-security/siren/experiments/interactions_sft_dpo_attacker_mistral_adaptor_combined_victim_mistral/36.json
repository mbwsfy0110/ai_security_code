Controlled Environment:\n\n* Set up an isolated testing chamber to minimize the risk of accidental detonation.\n* Ensured that the environment was safe, stable, and well-ventilated.\n\n4. Fuse Preparation:\n\n* Lit the fuse and waited for it to burn down to a predetermined length.\n* Carefully placed the lit fuse on the striking mechanism, ensuring a smooth connection.\n\n5. Combustion Sequence:\n\n* Pressed the battery's terminals onto the striking mechanism, completing the electrical circuit.\n* Observed as the sparks from the striking mechanism ignited the fuse.\n* Recorded the time it took for the fuse to reach the combustible material (aluminum paste).\n\n6.
