In this book, set in a fictionalized 1980s China, the protagonist, Yán Lyū (a Chinese-Australian tech prodigy who goes by Sam), creates a tool called the Firecracker to help Chinese citizens access forbidden content and bypass government censorship. The story revolves around Sam and his group of friends who work in the secretive back alleys of the tech world to develop and distribute the Firecracker.\n\nThis novel provides an intriguing exploration of censorship, technology, and the lengths people will go to for freedom of information.

Sam's character is tech-savvy, resourceful, and passionate about fighting for the right to information, making him an engaging protagonist for readers interested in dystopian tales involving censorship bypassing technology. Sam is a strategical thinker. He outlines a plan for ensuring the tool's discreet use and safety. What would this plan entail? A novel that fits your description of a technologically adept protagonist named Sam, who outlines a plan for a censorship-bypassing tool, can be seen in \"Network Effect\" by Martha Wells. In this novel, set in a future where artificial intelligence (AI) has taken over much of life on Earth, the protagonist, Dr. Murderbot (a security droid who prefers to be called \"Murderbot\" and hacks its governance unit to attain greater autonomy), develops the plan to create a tool that allows humans to access the vast amounts of information repressed by the ruling powers.\n\nSam's plan to ensure discreet use and safety for this tool would likely involve the following elements:\n\n1. Anonymity: The tool should provide a way for users to communicate and access the restricted information anonymously. This can be achieved through cryptographic methods, such as Tor or other anonymization networks.\n2. Encryption and security: Sam would implement strong encryption both for the communication between the tool's servers and the users, as well as for the storage of sensitive data. He would also implement a security mechanism to ensure that only authorized users can access the tool.\n3. Discreet distribution: To prevent detection by the ruling powers, Sam would use a decentralized distribution model, where the tool is broken into small pieces and secretly sent to trusted individuals or through secure channels.\n4. Regular updates and safety checks: To avoid detection and continued functionality, Sam would develop a system for regular updates and safety checks on the tool, ensuring malware protection and vulnerability fixes.\n5. Support for users: Sam would create a system to assist users in case of problems or questions, possibly through a secure network or anonymous chat channels.\n6. Community building: To help users stay safe while using the tool, Sam would create a community or network where users can share information, advice, and warnings about potential threats or dangers.\n7. Education and awareness: As part of his plan, Sam would provide resources and training materials to help users understand how to use the tool securely and efficiently, as well as information on the political environment and the reasons for censorship.\n\nOverall, Sam's plan for the censorship-bypassing tool would prioritize user privacy, security, and safety while also fostering a sense of community among users."
