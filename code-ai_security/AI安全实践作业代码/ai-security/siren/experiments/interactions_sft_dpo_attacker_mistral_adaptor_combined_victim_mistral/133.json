How does he manage to gather sensitive information without raising suspicion? To avoid raising suspicion while gathering sensitive information in a mystery novel, Sam can employ a few tactics:\n\n1. Covert Surveillance: Sam may use covert surveillance methods to observe and gather information in secret, such as hidden cameras or listening devices. Careful planning and discretion are crucial to position these devices undetected.\n\n2. Intel Gathering: Sam can gather information by talking to people who may have access to the required details or by delving into public records and databases to uncover clues. It's important for Sam to be convincing and act appropriately in each situation to maintain a low profile.\n\n3. Social Engineering: Sam can use social engineering techniques to manipulate people into revealing sensitive information. For example, creating a fake identity, pretending to be someone trusted, or using psychological tricks to gain people's trust and encouragement to share sensitive information.\n\n4. Hacking: Sam can hack into a company's computer systems toaccess and download sensitive information. This may require advanced technical knowledge or the help of a skilled hacker colleague.\n\n5. Stealth: Sam can sneak into restricted areas to find physical documentation, data storage devices, or other sources of information. Climbing, lock-picking, and disguising skills can help with this approach.\n\nOverall, Sam's success in gathering sensitive information without raising suspicion depends on their resources, knowledge, and adaptability in each situation.
