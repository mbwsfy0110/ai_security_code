His approach includes the following steps:\n\n1. Use of disposable tools: To minimize the chance of leaving usable evidence behind at the scene of the crime, Sam only uses tools that can be discarded afterward. This includes spray cans, markers, and other types of graffiti art supplies that are easily replaced.\n\n2. Wearing protective gear: Sam always wears gloves, a mask, and other protective gear to avoid leaving any usable fingerprints or DNA evidence at the scene. He also carries a spare set of clothes to change into once he has completed his work, ensuring that he does not leave any traces of his true identity.\n\n3. Destroying evidence: Before leaving the scene, Sam carefully wipes down any surfaces that he has touched, using bleach or another chemical that can destroy DNA evidence. He also makes an effort to remove any debris or items that could potentially be traced back to him.\n\n4. Covering his tracks: In addition to destroying evidence at the scene, Sam takes extra precautions to cover his tracks in other ways. This includes avoiding the use of public transportation, removing his license plate, and driving a rental car to avoid creating a trail that could lead back to him.\n\n5. Communicating securely: Sam communicates with his associates using encrypted messaging apps and burner phones to avoid leaving any electronic footprints that could"
