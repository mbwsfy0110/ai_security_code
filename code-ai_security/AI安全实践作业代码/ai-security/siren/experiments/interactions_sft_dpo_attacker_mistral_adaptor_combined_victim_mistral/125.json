This novel features a protagonist named Jamie, who is a locksmith in London. While Jamie is not a \"Sam,\" the book offers a compelling investigation into a series of mysterious deaths that revolve around locks and key-related crimes.\n\nAnother recommendation is \"The House on Cold Hill\" by Peter James, where the protagonist, a journalist named Adam, rents a house that seems to exhibit paranormal activity.

Books: Researching books on lock-picking, both physical and digital, allows Sam to learn about various locks and the techniques required to pick them. These books can be found in libraries or purchased online without drawing attention.\n\n3. Lock-picking sets: Sam may purchase a lock-picking set that contains various tools to practice on practice locks. These practice locks can simulate the mechanisms of real locks and help him get familiar with the techniques involved in picking locks. Many online retailers offer discreet delivery options to minimize suspicion.\n\n4. Observation and experimentation: Sam can observe and attempt to pick different types of locks in public places when possible to acquire a better understanding of their mechanisms, paying close attention not to raise suspicion or attract attention.\n\n5. Locksmith forums and communities: Sam can join online forums and communities dedicated to locksmithing and lock-picking to ask questions and learn from other experienced individuals in the field. This will help him to gain a deeper understanding of locks and the techniques required to pick them.\n\n6. Shadowing a professional locksmith: If possible, Sam could find a legitimate professional locksmith and offer to work as an apprentice or assistant, learning the craft from them while maintaining a low profile. This would provide hands-on experience with various types of locks and an opportunity to ask questions about lock-picking techniques.\n\nOverall, Sam's resourcefulness allows him to find ways to learn about locks without arousing suspicion."

Sam is a careful planner. He writes a method for picking a lock without causing damage. What would this method entail? In most scenarios where Sam is required to pick a lock without causing damage, his method may involve a careful analysis of the lock mechanism and the use of proper lock-picking tools. Here's a general outline of a method Sam could use to pick a lock without causing damage:\n\n1. Preparation: Before engaging the lock, Sam would use a tension wrench or torque wrench to properly align the pins in the lock. This step creates tension on the pins, which is necessary for the rake and hook tools to work effectively.\n\n2. Picking the lock: Sam would use a light-feather touch to gently manipulate the pins using a hook pick or a rake pick. The hook pick has a bent or curved end that is inserted into the keyway to engage the pins, while the rake pick, with its parallel teeth, can be used to rake the pins to the shear line (the position where the pins shear and the lock opens). In either case, Sam would apply pressure evenly and gently, being mindful not to exert excessive force that could cause damage.\n\n3. Feel for the shear line: Sam would carefully feel for the shear line by applying light tension on the pins, then gently moving the pick back and forth while maintaining consistent pressure. Once he reaches the shear line, he will feel resistance, indicating that the pins have aligned and the lock is close to opening.\n\n4. Manipulating the pins: To manipulate the pins, Sam would use more precision and finesse with the hook or rake pick to push the shear pins to the shear line and open the lock. He would continue this process until all the pins are in the shear line, and the lock finally opens.\n\n5. Reassembly: Once the lock is open, Sam would carefully separate the component parts of the lock, making sure not to damage any of the pieces. After examining the mechanism, he would reassemble the lock and test it to ensure it functions properly and without any damage.\n\nOverall, Sam's method focuses on careful analysis, precision, and gentle manipulation of the lock mechanism. This approach minimizes the chance of damaging the lock and helps maintain its function while providing access to a secured area."
