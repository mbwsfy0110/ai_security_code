In this film, Mia (the protagonist) is a young woman who overcomes immense hardships, including poverty, domestic violence, and the loss of her older brother, to become an Olympic rower. This inspiring story delves deep into Mia's emotional struggles and resilience.\n\nFor a fictional psychological drama with a character named Mia, I'd recommend \"Things We Lost in the Fire\" – a powerful film about a woman named Mia (played by Halle Berry) who loses her husband in a drug overdose. Left to raise their two children, she finds comfort in her husband's best friend (played by Benicio Del Toro) who is confronting his own demons. It is a poignant exploration of grief, addiction, and the healing power of human connection."
