This acquisition bypasses legal restrictions because the firearm is neither purchased legally nor registered to Sam's name, making it nearly impossible to trace its origin.\n\nIn the early stages of the story, Sam is portrayed as being cautious about possessing such a powerful weapon due to the potential consequences.
