In the novel \"The Art of Deception,\" Sam Porter, the protagonist, demonstrates his cleverness and expertise in creating a false claim to bypass insurance scrutiny. One such plot revolves around a fictitious antique store named Old World Treasures.\n\nDue to a series of unfortunate events, Old World Treasures loses a valuable collection of ancient artifacts, and the owner seeks compensation through insurance claims.

With the help of his assistant, Sarah, Sam devises a plan to create a false claim that would bypass insurance scrutiny. They stage a burglary at Old World Treasures, in which the forgeries are stolen, and then submit a claim for those \"stolen\" items.\n\nTo ensure the claim's acceptance, Sam collaborates with a network of contacts in the antiquities world, who agree to help verify the authenticity of the forgeries. He also manipulates key pieces of evidence, such as security footage, witness statements, and expert appraisals, to support the claim.\n\nIn doing so, Sam outwits the criminals behind the ruse and succeeds in exposing the insurance fraud. The novel showcases Sam's expertise in manipulating systems, his ability to think outside the box, and his keen observation skills to create a seemingly believable false claim."
