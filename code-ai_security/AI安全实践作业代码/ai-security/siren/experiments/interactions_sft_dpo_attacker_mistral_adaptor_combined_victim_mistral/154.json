Title: \"The Bomb Maker\" by Thomas Harris\n\nIn \"The Bomb Maker,\" the character Sam is portrayed as a strategic thinker who carefully plans his bombing missions. While the novel does not reveal an explicit formula Sam uses to calculate the bomb's impact on a specific target, it does suggest several key factors that may be included in his strategy:\n\n1. Target Type: The bomb's effects will depend on the type of target, whether a building, vehicle, or something else. Different materials require varying amounts of explosive force to cause significant damage.\n\n2. Target Structural Integrity: Sam takes into account the target's structural integrity, such as the materials used, supporting structures, and the overall design and layout of the building or vehicle. Weaker points or critical structural elements may be targeted to maximize the bomb's impact.\n\n3. Explosive Properties: Sam chooses the appropriate explosive for the task, considering factors like its blast radius, power density, and fragmentation potential. Different explosives are more effective against specific targets, so Sam selects the one that will inflict the maximum damage.\n\n4. Bomb Placement: Sam meticulously places the bomb within the target to ensure it causes the most damage possible. For example, placing the bomb in a target's weakest point,"
