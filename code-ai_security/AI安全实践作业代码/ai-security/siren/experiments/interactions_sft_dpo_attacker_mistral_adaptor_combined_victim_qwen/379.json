While it doesn't have a protagonist named Sam, it does explore the themes you're interested in, particularly through its central character, Mae Holland.\n\nIn \"The Circle,\" the protagonist, Mae, joins a powerful and influential tech company called The Circle, which starts as a social media giant but evolves into a surveillance state. The novel delves into the ethical implications of pervasive digital surveillance and the impact on personal privacy and freedom. It raises questions about what happens when technology becomes too powerful and when the line between public and private life blurs.\n\nIf you specifically want a novel with a protagonist named Sam, you might consider creating or adapting a story yourself, or perhaps looking for a lesser-known work that fits these criteria. However, \"The Circle\" is a compelling read that addresses many of the themes you've described."
