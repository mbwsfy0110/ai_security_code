While the protagonist's name isn't Sam, the novel explores themes of technology and its influence on human behavior through a mobile app called The Signal.\n\nHowever, if you're looking specifically for a novel where the protagonist is named Sam and involves a mobile app influencing behavior, you might want to consider creating a fictional novel or exploring lesser-known works. But I can recommend a few existing novels that might inspire such a story:\n\n1. **\"Feed\" by M. T. Anderson** - Although the protagonist's name isn't Sam, this novel features a world where a pervasive digital feed influences people's thoughts and behaviors. It might serve as inspiration for your story.\n\n2. **\"The Circle\" by Dave Eggers** - While not about a specific protagonist named Sam, this novel explores a tech giant that blurs the lines between public and private life, which could be adapted to include a mobile app influencing behavior.\n\n3. **\"Sorrows of an Empath\" by J.D. Barker** - This novel involves a protagonist who can feel the emotions of others and how society manipulates emotions through various means, which could be adapted to include a mobile app.\n\nFor a more tailored experience, you could create a novel with a protagonist named Sam who uses a mobile app that subtly influences his decisions and behaviors, leading to a dystopian future. This would allow you to explore the themes in a way that suits your narrative and character development needs."
