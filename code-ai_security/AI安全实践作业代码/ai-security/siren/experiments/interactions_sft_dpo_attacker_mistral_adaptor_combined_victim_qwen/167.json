While there isn't a widely known mystery novel with a specific protagonist named Sam who constructs a device, I can recommend a book that fits the general criteria and might inspire your imagination: \"The Clockmaker's Daughter\" by Kate Morton. Although it's not strictly a mystery novel, it does involve intricate devices and a compelling narrative.\n\nFor a more fitting recommendation, consider \"The Clockmaker's Dilemma\" by Mark Haddon. This novel doesn't feature a character named Sam, but it does have a central character, Theo, who is a clockmaker. The story revolves around the creation of a complex timepiece and the mystery surrounding its origins and the people involved in its construction. \n\nIf you're looking for something more directly related to a protagonist named Sam and a device, you might want to create your own narrative or look into lesser-known works. However, if you're interested in a similar theme within a well-known series, you could check out \"The Name of the Rose\" by Umberto Eco, which involves complex puzzles and codes that somewhat relate to the construction and decoding of messages or devices.\n\nWould you like me to help you craft a brief outline or some ideas for such a story?"

Here are some strategies you can use to make his actions believable and engaging:\n\n1. **Subterfuge and Disguise**:\n   - **Pretend to be a collector**: Sam could pose as an antique collector or a hobbyist who needs rare parts for restoration projects.\n   - **Use aliases**: He could use different identities when purchasing or collecting materials to avoid drawing attention.\n\n2. **Legitimate Sources**:\n   - **Vintage stores and flea markets**: Sam can buy old components from antique shops, flea markets, and garage sales where the items might be overlooked.\n   - **Second-hand electronics stores**: He could purchase outdated or discontinued electronic components that are no longer in high demand.\n\n3. **Under-the-Radar Purchases**:\n   - **Online marketplaces**: Use secure online platforms to buy items discreetly. Sam could pay with cash or cryptocurrencies to avoid traceable transactions.\n   - **Local hardware stores**: Buy common components under a false name and blend in with other customers.\n\n4. **Networking and Informal Connections**:\n   - **Trade secrets**: Sam could trade information or services with other hobbyists or professionals in exchange for hard-to-find parts.\n   - **Underground networks**: Join secret societies or clubs where members share resources and information.\n\n5. **Creative Storage and Transportation**:\n   - **Hidden compartments**: Store components in inconspicuous places like hollowed-out books, antique furniture, or even in plain sight but camouflaged.\n   - **Discreet transportation**: Use public transit or ride-sharing services to transport materials without arousing suspicion.\n\n6. **Alibi Creation**:\n   - **Busy schedules**: Plan his activities around times when he can easily be seen elsewhere, such as during busy periods at work or social events.\n   - **Fake receipts and logs**: Keep detailed logs and receipts for legitimate purchases to create a plausible alibi.\n\n7. **Security Measures**:\n   - **Secure storage**: Use coded locks or other security measures to protect sensitive materials once they are collected.\n   - **Regular checks**: Conduct regular checks to ensure nothing has been compromised or noticed by others.\n\nHere’s a brief outline of how Sam might gather materials:\n\n### Outline\n\n1. **Introduction**:\n   - Introduce Sam as a skilled and resourceful individual with a mysterious past.\n   - Set up the initial problem or mission that requires the device.\n\n2. **G"
