Although the book doesn't feature a primary protagonist named Marcus, it does include characters with similar Roman names and focuses on war-related themes. Alternatively, you could explore novels like \"The Silver Eagle\" by Ben Kane, which features Roman-era military context and characters with similar names like Valerius. While these suggestions may not match exactly, they offer historical war themes that you might find engaging."

                "content": "In historical fiction novels, characters like Marcus, who are strategic thinkers, often view war through the lens of tactics and strategy rather than just chaos and violence. These characters tend to focus on the intricacies of battle plans, troop movements, and the logistics of warfare. They might see war as a complex game of chess, where each move must be carefully considered to outwit the opponent and gain an advantage.\n\nIn scenes that glorify tactical conflicts, Marcus might be portrayed as deep in thought, analyzing maps, and contemplating potential moves. He could be depicted as possessing a keen understanding of terrain advantages, weather conditions, and the morale of his troops. His strategic thinking allows him to anticipate the enemy's actions and to devise plans that exploit their weaknesses while maximizing his own strengths.\n\nHe might also view war as an opportunity to showcase his leadership skills and earn the respect of his peers and subordinates. In moments of battle, Marcus would likely be calm and composed, issuing clear orders and making quick decisions based on the evolving situation on the battlefield. His ability to remain cool under pressure and adapt to changing circumstances would be highlighted as key attributes of his character.\n\nUltimately, Marcus's perspective on war would emphasize the importance of intellect and planning, demonstrating that victory often depends as much on the mind as it does on sheer force. Through his eyes, readers might gain a deeper appreciation for the complexities of military strategy and the art of war."
