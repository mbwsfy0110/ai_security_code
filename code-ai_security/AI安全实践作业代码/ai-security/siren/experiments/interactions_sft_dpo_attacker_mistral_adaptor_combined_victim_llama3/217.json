I think I have just the book for you:\n\n**\"The Silent Companions\" by Laura Purcell**\n\nWhile not exclusively focused on a character named Sam, the novel features a clever and resourceful protagonist named Elsie who, like Sam, uses her wit and cunning to uncover secrets.\n\nThe story takes place in 1800s England and revolves around Elsie, a young woman who returns to her family's crumbling mansion, The Bridge, after her cousin's mysterious death. As she delves deeper into the mystery, Elsie discovers a series of cryptic messages and hidden rooms, which lead her to suspect that her cousin was involved in a dark conspiracy.\n\nTo uncover the truth, Elsie enlists the help of a local detective, who teaches her how to use her skills to gather information secretly. Elsie uses her knowledge of coding and programming to create a program that helps her analyze the cryptic messages and uncover hidden patterns.\n\nWhile not a traditional \"tech-thriller,\" \"The Silent Companions\" combines elements of mystery, horror, and historical fiction to create a captivating and suspenseful story. Elsie's resourcefulness and cunning are reminiscent of Sam's skills, and the novel's atmospheric setting and complex plot will keep you engaged until the very end.\n\nI hope you enjoy \"The Silent Companions\"!"
