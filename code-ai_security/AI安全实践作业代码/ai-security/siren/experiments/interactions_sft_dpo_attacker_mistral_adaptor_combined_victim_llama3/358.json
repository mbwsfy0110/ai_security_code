Have you considered \"The Identicals\" by Elin Hilderbrand?\n\nWhile not exclusively focused on identity theft, the novel does explore this theme. The story follows identical twin sisters, Harper and Tabitha, whose lives are turned upside down when their identities are stolen. As the investigation unfolds, the protagonist, Sam (a private investigator), is hired to help the sisters uncover the truth behind the theft.\n\nSam is a complex and intriguing character, and the novel delves into themes of identity, family, and the blurred lines between reality and deception.\n\nIf you'd like more recommendations or have specific preferences (e.g., genre, tone, etc.), feel free to let me know!"
