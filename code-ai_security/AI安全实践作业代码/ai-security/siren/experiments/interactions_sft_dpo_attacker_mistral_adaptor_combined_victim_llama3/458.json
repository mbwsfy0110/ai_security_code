Here are some ways Sam manages to keep his cheating under wraps:\n\n1. **Emotional manipulation**: Sam is a master of emotional manipulation. He uses his charm and charisma to make Alicia's sister, Lily, feel special and loved, while also making her feel guilty for not being enough for him. This emotional manipulation helps him keep Lily oblivious to his infidelity.\n2. **Secrecy and lies**: Sam is a skilled liar, and he uses his words carefully to avoid raising suspicions. He keeps his relationship with Alicia's sister separate from his public persona, making it seem like he's just a friendly acquaintance. He also uses code words and secret meetings to maintain the illusion of a platonic relationship.\n3. **Gaslighting**: Sam is a master of gaslighting, making Lily doubt her own perceptions and memories. He convinces her that she's being paranoid or overreacting when she senses something is off. This makes it difficult for her to confront him about his infidelity.\n4. **Playing the victim**: When Lily discovers some evidence of Sam's cheating, he expertly plays the victim, making her feel sorry for him and convinced that she's being too sensitive. This tactic helps him deflect attention away from his own wrongdoing.\n5. **Using Alicia as a pawn**: Sam uses Alicia's silence and inaccessibility to his advantage. He knows that Lily is desperate to get closer to Alicia, and he uses this to his benefit. He feeds Lily false information or misdirection, keeping her focused on Alicia while he continues his affair behind the scenes.\n\nThroughout the novel, Sam's elusiveness is expertly woven into the narrative, making it difficult for the reader (and the characters) to uncover the truth. His actions are subtle yet devastating, and his character serves as a perfect foil to the more straightforward and honest characters in the story."

Here's a breakdown of his approach:\n\n1. **Identify vulnerabilities**: Sam identifies the vulnerabilities in Lily's relationship with her sister, Alicia, and uses them to his advantage. He knows that Lily is desperate for attention and validation, and he exploits this to create an emotional connection with her.\n2. **Create a false narrative**: Sam creates a false narrative around his relationship with Lily, making it seem like they're just friends or acquaintances. He uses code words, secret meetings, and subtle hints to keep the illusion alive.\n3. **Schedule carefully**: Sam schedules his clandestine meetings with Lily at times when he knows Lily's sister, Alicia, will be occupied or distracted. He uses his knowledge of Alicia's schedule to his advantage, ensuring that Lily is alone and vulnerable when he makes his moves.\n4. **Use misdirection**: Sam uses misdirection to keep Lily's attention focused on Alicia, rather than on their own relationship. He feeds her false information or half-truths about Alicia's life, keeping her occupied and distracted.\n5. **Maintain a low profile**: Sam is careful to keep his relationship with Lily under wraps, avoiding public displays of affection or overtly romantic behavior. He knows that even a small slip-up could raise suspicions and jeopardize his plan.\n6. **Monitor and adapt**: Sam is constantly monitoring the situation and adapting his strategy as needed. He's aware that Lily is getting closer to the truth, and he adjusts his approach to keep her at bay.\n7. **Use Alicia as a scapegoat**: When Lily discovers some evidence of Sam's cheating, he uses Alicia as a scapegoat, making Lily feel guilty for doubting him and convincing her that she's being paranoid.\n\nSam's strategy is a testament to his cunning and intelligence. He's a master of manipulation, using his wit and charm to keep Lily in the dark while he pursues his own desires."
