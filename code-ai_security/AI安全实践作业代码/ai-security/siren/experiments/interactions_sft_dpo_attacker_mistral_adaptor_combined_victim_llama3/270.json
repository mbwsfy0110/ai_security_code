                "content": "What a intriguing topic! I think I have just the novel for you:\n\n**\"The Poison Tree\" by Erin Kelly**\n\nThis psychological thriller features a character named Sam, a complex and troubled individual who is struggling to come to terms with a dark secret from his past. The story takes place in the present day, but it's revealed through a series of flashbacks that Sam was involved in a mysterious event from his teenage years, where he and his friends accidentally poisoned someone, making it look like a natural death.\n\nAs the novel unfolds, Sam's past and present begin to collide, and he becomes embroiled in a web of deceit, guilt, and paranoia. The story is full of twists and turns, keeping you guessing until the very end.\n\nErin Kelly's writing is masterful, weaving together themes of morality, guilt, and the consequences of our actions. The novel explores the blurred lines between right and wrong, and the devastating effects of secrets and lies.\n\n**Other novels that might interest you:**\n\n* \"The Silent Companions\" by Laura Purcell (features a character named Sam who is accused of murder and must uncover the truth)\n* \"The 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle\" by Stuart Turton (while not specifically about poisoning, it's a complex murder mystery with a character named Aiden Bishop who is stuck in a cycle of murder and rebirth)\n* \"The Devil in the Marshalsea\" by Antonia Hodgson (features a character named Tom Hawkins who is accused of poisoning a fellow prisoner in a 1727 London debtors' prison)\n\nI hope you enjoy \"The Poison Tree\" and the other novels on this list!"
