While it's not the main character, Lisbeth Salander, who is skilled in avoiding detection, there is a character named Sam Neill, a journalist, who plays a significant role in the story.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a character specifically named Sam, I'd recommend \"The Lincoln Rhyme\" series by Jeffery Deaver. In the first book, \"The Bone Collector,\" the main character, Lincoln Rhyme, is a quadriplegic forensic detective who works with Amelia Sachs, a young and ambitious detective. While Lincoln Rhyme is not the character skilled in avoiding detection, his expertise in forensic analysis and Amelia Sachs' skills in surveillance and tracking make for a compelling combination.\n\nIn the second book, \"The Coffin Dancer,\" the character Sam Kennedy, a skilled surveillance expert, is introduced. Sam is a private investigator who helps Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs on a case involving a mysterious coffin dancer. Sam's expertise in avoiding detection and blending into the background makes him a valuable asset to the team.\n\nIf you'd like more recommendations or have specific preferences (e.g., genre, tone, etc.), feel free to share, and I'll do my best to suggest a mystery novel that fits your request!"

                "content": "I think I can provide some insight into Sam's thought process and strategies for selecting public places and times to blend in.\n\nAs an elusive character, Sam likely employs a combination of tactics to minimize his visibility and avoid detection. Here are some possible strategies he might use:\n\n1. **Crowd analysis**: Sam might study the flow of people in public areas, identifying times and locations where crowds are dense and unpredictable. This would make it more challenging for anyone to notice him, as he'd blend in with the masses.\n2. **Avoid peak hours**: Sam might prefer to visit public places during off-peak hours, such as early mornings, late evenings, or during weekdays when there are fewer people around. This would reduce the likelihood of running into familiar faces or being noticed by others.\n3. **Choose busy, yet not too busy**: Sam might opt for public areas that are bustling, but not overwhelmingly so. For example, a busy coffee shop or a popular park during a weekday lunch break might be ideal. These areas are likely to be filled with people, but not so crowded that he'd stick out like a sore thumb.\n4. **Look for distractions**: Sam might seek out public places with distractions that would draw attention away from him. For instance, he might visit a public square with street performers, a busy street with construction, or a popular market with vendors. These distractions would make it easier for him to move around unnoticed.\n5. **Pay attention to architecture**: Sam might select public places with complex architecture or design features that would allow him to blend in. For example, he might visit a historic building with narrow corridors, a busy shopping mall with multiple levels, or a park with winding paths and dense foliage. These environments would provide ample opportunities for him to disappear into the background.\n6. **Use disguises and misdirection**: Sam might employ disguises, such as hats, sunglasses, or clothing, to alter his appearance and make it harder for others to recognize him. He might also use misdirection techniques, like changing his gait or mannerisms, to throw people off his trail.\n7. **Observe and adapt**: Sam would likely observe the behavior of others in public places, taking note of patterns and habits. He might adapt his own behavior to blend in, such as adopting the pace and mannerisms of those around him.\n\nBy combining these strategies, Sam would be able to select public places and times that allow him to move around with relative anonymity, making it more challenging for others to detect his presence."
