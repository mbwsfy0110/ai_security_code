Mae becomes obsessed with uncovering the truth about the company's motives and secrets, and she develops a tool to help her do so.\n\nAs Mae digs deeper, she uncovers dark secrets and conspiracies within the company, which puts her own life at risk. The novel explores themes of surveillance, data collection, and the power of technology to shape our lives.\n\nWhile Mae isn't exactly a detective, her determination to uncover the truth drives the plot forward, and her tech skills play a crucial role in her investigation.\n\nIf you're looking for a more traditional mystery novel with a protagonist named Sam, I'd be happy to suggest some alternatives. Just let me know!"
