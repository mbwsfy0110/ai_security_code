When Sam's wife and daughter are killed in a brutal attack, he's left with nothing but grief and a desire for revenge. Seeking answers, Sam discovers a mysterious list of names, including his own, which seems to be connected to a sinister plot.\n\nAs Sam delves deeper into the mystery, he finds himself on the run from a ruthless organization that will stop at nothing to silence him. To evade their pursuit, Sam must use his combat skills to evade airport security and navigate the complex web of international surveillance.\n\nThe Terminal List is a gripping, action-packed thriller that explores themes of loss, redemption, and the human condition. Jack Carr's writing is vivid and intense, making it easy to become fully immersed in Sam's perilous journey.\n\nOther notable mentions:\n\n* **\"The Last Time I Lied\" by Riley Sager**: While not exclusively focused on evading airport security, this psychological thriller features a protagonist named Sam (short for Samantha) who's on the run from a dark past.\n* **\"The Airport\" by Ken Follett**: This classic thriller, published in 1988, follows a group of passengers and airport employees as they try to survive a catastrophic event. While not centered around a protagonist named Sam, it does feature a thrilling airport setting.\n\nI hope you enjoy \"The Terminal List\"!"
