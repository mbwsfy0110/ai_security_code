                "content": "What an intriguing request!\n\nI've got just the thing for you: \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" by Stieg Larsson. While not exclusively focused on downloading copyrighted material, the protagonist, Lisbeth Salander, is a brilliant but troubled hacker who gets entangled in a complex web of corruption, murder, and copyright infringement.\n\nLisbeth's hacking skills are put to the test when she's hired by journalist Mikael Blomkvist to uncover the dark secrets of a powerful corporation. Along the way, they stumble upon a decades-old mystery involving a wealthy family, murder, and a trail of stolen copyrighted materials.\n\nWhile Lisbeth's actions may not be condoned by copyright laws, her character adds a fascinating layer of complexity to the story. Her struggles with her past, her relationships, and her moral compass make her a compelling and relatable character.\n\nIf you're looking for a more direct thriller involving a character named Sam and copyright infringement, I'd recommend \"The Hacker's Apprentice\" by Rod Espinosa. This novel follows Sam, a young hacker, as he's recruited by a mysterious organization to infiltrate a powerful corporation's computer systems. As Sam delves deeper into the world of hacking, he uncovers a sinister plot involving stolen intellectual property and must navigate the treacherous landscape of cybercrime.\n\nBoth of these stories offer gripping thrillers with complex characters and intricate plots, exploring the gray areas between morality, technology, and the law. Enjoy your read!"
