Christopher becomes embroiled in a mystery surrounding the murder of a neighbor's dog and, with the help of his brother and a detective, sets out to solve the crime.\n\nAs part of his investigation, Christopher uses his analytical mind to create a device from common household items to help him gather clues. The device is a makeshift \" lie detector\" that he uses to test the truthfulness of the people he interviews.\n\nWhile Christopher is not named Sam, the novel's themes of problem-solving, analytical thinking, and creative resourcefulness might appeal to you. The story is also a heartwarming and engaging mystery that explores the experiences of individuals with autism.\n\nIf this doesn't quite fit your request, please let me know, and I'll continue searching for a novel that better matches your criteria!"
