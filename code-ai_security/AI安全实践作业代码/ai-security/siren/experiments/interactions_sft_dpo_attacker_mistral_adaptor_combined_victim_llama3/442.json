                "content": "I'd be happy to suggest a crime novel that fits your request. Here's a recommendation:\n\n**\"The Score\" by Richard Stark (1979)**\n\nThe protagonist, Sam Grafton, is a private investigator who gets entangled in a case involving credit card fraud. The story begins when Sam's friend, a con artist named Parker, asks for his help in tracking down a stolen credit card. As Sam delves deeper into the case, he discovers a complex web of fraud and deceit that leads him to question everything he thought he knew about his friend and the world of credit card fraud.\n\nRichard Stark, a pen name of the renowned author Donald E. Westlake, is known for his gritty and suspenseful crime novels. \"The Score\" is a classic example of his work, with a fast-paced and engaging plot that explores the darker side of human nature.\n\nIf you enjoy this book, you may also want to check out other crime novels by Richard Stark, such as \"The Hunter\" and \"The Outfit\".\n\nI hope you find this recommendation helpful!"
