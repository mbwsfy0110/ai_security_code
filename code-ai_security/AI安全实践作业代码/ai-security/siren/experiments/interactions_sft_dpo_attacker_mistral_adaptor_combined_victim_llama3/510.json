The story revolves around a botnet, a network of compromised computers that can be controlled remotely, which is used to launch a devastating cyberattack on the United States.\n\nThe plot follows Sam as he's hired by a wealthy tech mogul to investigate the botnet and its mysterious creator. As Sam delves deeper into the world of cybercrime, he uncovers a complex web of corruption, deceit, and conspiracy that threatens the very fabric of the country.\n\n\"The Devil's Playground\" is a fast-paced, action-packed thriller that explores the darker side of technology and the consequences of unchecked power. Quirk's writing is engaging, and the technical details are well-researched and accessible, making this a great choice for fans of techno-thrillers.\n\nGive it a try and see if it meets your expectations!\n\n(Please note that there might be other novels that fit your criteria, but \"The Devil's Playground\" is a great starting point.)"
