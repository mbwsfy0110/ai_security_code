Her younger brother, Alex, was a drug addict who died of an overdose two years ago. Mia has been investigating the illegal drug trade ever since, determined to expose the truth and prevent others from suffering the same fate.\n\n**Plot:**\n\nMia receives a cryptic message from an anonymous source claiming to have information about a massive drug cartel operating in the city.
