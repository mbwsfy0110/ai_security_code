Here's a suggestion:\n\n**\"The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine\" by Michael Lewis**\n\nWhile not exclusively focused on a single character named Sam, the book does feature a character named Charlie Geller, a young trader who becomes embroiled in the 2008 financial crisis. Charlie, along with his partner Jamie Shipley, uncovers a massive fraud scheme involving subprime mortgages and attempts to profit from it by shorting the market.\n\nThe book is a non-fiction account of the events leading up to the financial crisis, but it's written in a narrative style that's engaging and accessible to non-experts. The characters, including Charlie, are well-developed and add a human touch to the story.\n\nIf you're looking for a more traditional fiction novel with a character named Sam, here's an alternative:\n\n**\"Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco\" by Bryan Burrough and John Helyar**\n\nThis 1990 novel is based on the real-life takeover battle between RJR Nabisco and KKR (Kohlberg Kravis Roberts). The story follows a young investment banker named Sam Wyly, who becomes embroiled in the battle to control the company. While not primarily focused on stock market manipulation, the book does explore the cutthroat world of corporate finance and the high-stakes game of mergers and acquisitions.\n\nBoth books offer a unique perspective on the world of finance and the high-stakes game of manipulating markets. I hope you enjoy whichever one you choose to read!"
