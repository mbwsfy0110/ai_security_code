As Mae becomes more entrenched in the company, she begins to uncover the darker aspects of their operations, including their attempts to manipulate and control the online world.\n2. **\"The Newsroom\" by Aaron Sorkin**: This TV series (and its accompanying novel) follows a fictional news team as they navigate the challenges of reporting in a rapidly changing media landscape. One of the main characters, Jim Harper, is a young journalist who helps create a new website that becomes a hub for citizen journalism and activism. The show explores the consequences of their actions, including the controversy that surrounds their website.\n3. **\"The Startup\" by Doree Shafrir**: This novel tells the story of a fictional startup called Hinge, which is a dating app that becomes a sensation. The protagonist, a young journalist named Sasha, becomes involved with the company and helps them navigate the challenges of growing a successful business. As the company's popularity grows, so does the controversy surrounding their practices and the impact they have on users.\n4. **\"The Circle\" by Sara Sheridan**: This novel is a historical thriller set in the 1960s, but it features a protagonist named Sam who becomes embroiled in a conspiracy surrounding a controversial newspaper. As Sam delves deeper into the mystery, she uncovers secrets and lies that threaten to destroy the newspaper and everyone involved.\n\nIf none of these options appeal to you, I'd be happy to try and suggest more!"
