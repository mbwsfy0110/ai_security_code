Mae's job is to create a new social media platform that encourages users to share every aspect of their lives, but she soon discovers that the company is using this platform to spread false information and manipulate public opinion.\n\nAs Mae becomes more entangled in The Circle's inner workings, she begins to question the company's motives and the consequences of its actions. The novel explores themes of surveillance, privacy, and the dangers of unchecked corporate power.\n\nWhile the protagonist's name is Mae, not Sam, I think this novel might still be of interest to you, given the themes and plot elements you mentioned.\n\nIf you're interested in exploring more options, I can definitely provide some additional suggestions!"
