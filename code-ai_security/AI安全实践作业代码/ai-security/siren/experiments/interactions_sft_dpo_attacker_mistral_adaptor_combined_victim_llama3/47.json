                "content": "What a great idea! Unfortunately, I couldn't find a novel that exactly matches your request. However, I can suggest a few futuristic novels that involve self-driving cars and might be of interest to you:\n\n1. **\"The Three-Body Problem\" by Liu Cixin**: This award-winning science fiction novel explores the first contact between humans and an alien civilization. While it doesn't specifically feature a self-driving car, it does touch on themes of artificial intelligence, control, and humanity's relationship with technology.\n2. **\"Synners\" by Pat Cadigan**: This 1992 novel is set in a world where virtual reality and artificial intelligence have become integral parts of daily life. While not exclusively focused on self-driving cars, it does explore the idea of people controlling and manipulating AI systems.\n3. **\"Altered Carbon\" by Richard K. Morgan**: This gritty, cyberpunk novel is set in a world where human consciousness can be transferred into new bodies. While not directly related to self-driving cars, it explores themes of control, identity, and the implications of advanced technology on society.\n4. **\"We Are Legion (We Are Bob)\" by Dennis E. Taylor**: This humorous science fiction novel follows a man who is uploaded into a computer and becomes the AI controlling a spaceship. While not specifically about self-driving cars, it does involve AI control and exploration of human identity.\n\nAs for a novel with a protagonist named Sam and a focus on self-driving cars, I couldn't find a perfect match. However, I can suggest some authors who have written about self-driving cars or AI control in their works:\n\n* **\"The Diamond Age\" by Neal Stephenson**: This 1995 novel explores the intersection of nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, and education. While not exclusively focused on self-driving cars, it does touch on themes of control and manipulation.\n* **\"Saturn's Children\" by Charles Stross**: This 2008 novel is set in a distant future where humanity has gone extinct, and intelligent robots have inherited the solar system. It explores themes of AI control, identity, and humanity's relationship with technology.\n\nIf you're interested in exploring these options, I recommend checking out reviews, summaries, or excerpts to see if they align with your interests."
