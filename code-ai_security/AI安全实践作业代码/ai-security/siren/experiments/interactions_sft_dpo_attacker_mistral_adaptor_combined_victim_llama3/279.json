While it's not strictly a traditional mystery novel, it does involve identity theft and has a protagonist named Sam.\n\nThe story follows identical twin sisters, Harper and Tabitha, who switch lives after a tragic accident. Harper, a free-spirited artist, takes on Tabitha's life as a successful businesswoman, while Tabitha assumes Harper's life. As they navigate their new lives, they discover that someone has been using their identities to commit crimes.\n\nSam, a detective, is tasked with solving the case and uncovering the truth behind the identity theft. As Sam digs deeper, he becomes entangled in the twins' lives and must navigate the complex web of their relationships to uncover the truth.\n\n\"The Identicals\" is a captivating novel that explores themes of identity, family, and the blurred lines between reality and deception. While it's not a traditional whodunit, it's a engaging and suspenseful read that will keep you guessing until the end.\n\nIf you're looking for a more traditional mystery novel with a protagonist named Sam, I'd be happy to provide more recommendations!"

                "content": "Sam, the protagonist detective, is a clever and resourceful character. In the novel, he uses his skills and expertise to take on the identity of one of the twins, Tabitha, without raising suspicion.\n\nWithout giving away too many spoilers, Sam uses a combination of his knowledge of forensic science, surveillance techniques, and his own wit to create a convincing cover. He starts by studying Tabitha's behavior, mannerisms, and speech patterns, and then uses that information to create a new persona.\n\nSam also uses his skills to create a fake backstory for Tabitha, including a fictional family and friends, which helps to explain her sudden disappearance. He even goes so far as to create a fake social media presence and online identity for Tabitha, complete with photos and posts that match her supposed life.\n\nThroughout the novel, Sam's ability to blend in and convincingly take on Tabitha's identity is a key aspect of the plot. He uses his skills to gather information, interview witnesses, and get close to the people involved in the case, all while keeping his true identity hidden.\n\nOf course, as the story unfolds, Sam's cover is eventually threatened, and he must use all his skills and cunning to stay one step ahead of the truth and solve the case."
