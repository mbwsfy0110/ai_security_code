When a wealthy tech mogul hires him to investigate a potential breach of his company's system, Sam discovers that the hack goes much deeper - into the very heart of the US government.\n\nAs Sam delves deeper into the mystery, he uncovers a complex web of corruption, deceit, and conspiracy that threatens national security. With his expertise in hacking and surveillance, Sam must navigate the treacherous landscape of government agencies, corporate espionage, and cybercrime to uncover the truth.\n\n\"The Trust\" is a gripping, fast-paced thriller that explores the dark side of technology and the blurred lines between public and private sectors. Robert Crais is a master of crafting suspenseful plots, and Sam is a relatable and likable protagonist.\n\nIf you enjoy \"The Trust,\" you might also like:\n\n* \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" by Stieg Larsson (while not exactly about hacking, it features a similar theme of corporate espionage and government corruption)\n* \"The Net\" by William Gibson (a classic cyberpunk novel that explores the intersection of technology and politics)\n* \"The Illuminatus! Trilogy\" by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson (a surreal, conspiracy-laden novel that explores the darker side of government and technology)\n\nHope you find something that piques your interest!"
