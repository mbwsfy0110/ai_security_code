To survive, Sam must use his wits to uncover a conspiracy involving a mysterious device that can manipulate the very fabric of reality. As he navigates the treacherous world of debtors, thieves, and corrupt officials, Sam must construct a plan to escape the prison and uncover the truth behind the device.\n\nWhile the device itself isn't constructed from everyday objects, the novel does feature clever uses of everyday items to aid Sam in his quest. The story is a thrilling blend of historical fiction, suspense, and mystery, with a dash of steampunk elements.\n\nI hope you enjoy \"The Devil in the Marshalsea\"!"
