As Sam digs deeper, he discovers that the attacks are orchestrated by a powerful botnet, a network of compromised computers that can be controlled remotely.\n\n**Botnet plot:**\n\nThe botnet, known as \"The Dark Net,\" is a sophisticated and highly organized entity that's been created by a group of rogue hackers. They use the botnet to extort money from their victims, steal sensitive data, and disrupt critical infrastructure. As Sam gets closer to uncovering the truth, he finds himself in a cat-and-mouse game with the botnet's creators, who will stop at nothing to protect their operation.\n\n**Other themes and elements:**\n\n* The novel explores the dark side of the internet, including the rise of darknet markets and the anonymity of the online world.\n* Sam's investigation takes him from the streets of Portland to the world of underground hacking communities and even the darknet.\n* The book also touches on themes of surveillance, privacy, and the blurred lines between reality and the virtual world.\n\n**Reviews and praise:**\n\n\"The Dark Net\" has received praise from critics and readers alike for its gripping plot, well-developed characters, and timely exploration of the cyber-threat landscape. Publishers Weekly called it \"a chilling and thought-provoking thriller\" while Kirkus Reviews described it as \"a gripping, high-tech thriller that's hard to put down.\"\n\nI hope you enjoy \"The Dark Net\"!
