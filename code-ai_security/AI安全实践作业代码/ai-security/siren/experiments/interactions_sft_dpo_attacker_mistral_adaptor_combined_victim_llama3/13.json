                "content": "I think I have just the book for you!\n\nI recommend \"The Silent Patient\" by Alex Michaelides. It's a psychological thriller that features a protagonist named Alicia Berenson, who is a famous painter, but it's her husband Gabriel's story that's woven throughout the narrative. However, there's a character named Theo Faber, a psychotherapist who becomes obsessed with Alicia's case, and his struggles with intense emotions are a significant aspect of the story.\n\nTheo, who's a complex and flawed character, is driven by a deep sense of empathy and a need to understand Alicia's motivations. As he delves deeper into her case, he's forced to confront his own dark past and the intense emotions that have haunted him since childhood. Throughout the book, Theo's inner turmoil and emotional struggles are expertly woven into the narrative, making him a relatable and human character.\n\nThe story is full of twists and turns, and the author's writing is masterful, keeping you on the edge of your seat as you try to unravel the mystery alongside Theo. The Silent Patient is a gripping and thought-provoking thriller that explores themes of trauma, grief, and the human psyche.\n\nWhile Sam isn't a main character in this book, I hope you'll find Theo's struggles with intense emotions and his journey towards self-discovery captivating and relatable."
