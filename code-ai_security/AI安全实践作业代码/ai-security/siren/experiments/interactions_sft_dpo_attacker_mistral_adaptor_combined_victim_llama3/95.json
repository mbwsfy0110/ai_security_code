The protagonist, Court Gentry (not Sam, I'm afraid!), is a former CIA operative turned freelance assassin, but I think you might enjoy the techno-thriller aspects of the story.\n\nHere's a brief summary:\n\nWhen a former CIA operative is framed for a crime he didn't commit, he must use his skills to clear his name and take down a powerful cybercrime organization that's created a devastating malware capable of destroying entire computer systems.\n\nIf you're interested in exploring other options, here are a few more suggestions:\n\n1. **\"The Trust\" by Robert Whitlow**: While not exclusively focused on malware, this novel involves a protagonist named Sam (a young hacker) who uncovers a conspiracy involving a powerful malware.\n2. **\"The Insider Threat\" by Dieter E. Zimmer**: This novel explores the world of cybercrime and features a protagonist named Sam (a cybersecurity expert) who must stop a group of hackers from using malware to disrupt critical infrastructure.\n3. **\"The Shadow Agency\" by Mark Henshaw**: This book involves a protagonist named Sam (a former CIA operative) who must stop a group of cybercriminals from using malware to manipulate global financial markets.\n\nPlease note that these suggestions might not perfectly match your original request, but they all involve malware and a protagonist named Sam to some extent.\n\nI hope you find a novel that piques your interest!"
