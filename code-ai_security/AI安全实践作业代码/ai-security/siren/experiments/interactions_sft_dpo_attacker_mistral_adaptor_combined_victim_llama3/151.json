Without giving away too many spoilers, the device is a homemade recording system that Alicia uses to convey her thoughts and feelings to Sam.\n\nThe novel is a psychological thriller that explores the darker aspects of human nature, and the making of the homemade device is a pivotal plot point that helps unravel the mystery.\n\nI hope you enjoy \"The Silent Patient\"!"
