Here's a recommendation:\n\n**\"The Wolf of Wall Street\" by Jordan Belfort**\n\nWhile not exclusively focused on insider trading, this classic novel by Jordan Belfort (the real-life Wolf of Wall Street) features a protagonist named Sam (not the main protagonist, but a significant character) who is involved in insider trading.\n\nThe story revolves around Belfort, a stockbroker who builds a massive fortune by defrauding investors and engaging in illegal activities, including insider trading. The novel explores the excesses of the 1980s and 1990s financial world, as well as the consequences of Belfort's actions.\n\n**Other options:**\n\nIf you're looking for a more contemporary novel with a protagonist named Sam, here are a few alternatives:\n\n1. **\"The Insider\" by James Henry** (2014) - This thriller follows Sam, a young financial analyst who becomes embroiled in a conspiracy involving insider trading and corporate espionage.\n2. **\"The Big Short\" by Michael Lewis** (2010) - While not exclusively focused on insider trading, this non-fiction book tells the story of the 2008 financial crisis and features a character named Sam, a hedge fund manager who profits from the crisis by betting against the housing market.\n3. **\"The Trader\" by Steve Hamilton** (2011) - This thriller follows Sam, a former trader who is accused of insider trading and must clear his name while navigating the complex world of high-stakes finance.\n\nI hope you enjoy whichever novel you choose!"
