The song is a reflection of her internal battle, where she's searching for a way to escape the darkness that haunts her.\n\n* \"Lost in the haze\" suggests a sense of disorientation and confusion, as if she's struggling to find her way through the chaos in her mind.\n* \"Memories that haunt me\" and \"ghosts that I've made\" imply that she's grappling with past traumas or regrets that continue to affect her.\n* The line \"I'm trapped in this cage of my own making\" suggests that she feels responsible for her own suffering, and that she's struggling to break free from the negative thought patterns and behaviors that are holding her back.\n* \"Prisoner of my thoughts\" and \"demons that I'm facing\" emphasize the sense of being overwhelmed by her own mental health struggles.\n* The repeated refrain of \"I'm screaming for help, but no one can hear\" suggests a sense of isolation and feeling unheard, which can exacerbate feelings of despair and hopelessness.\n\n**Themes:**\n\n* The song explores themes of mental health, trauma, and the struggle to find hope and healing in the"
