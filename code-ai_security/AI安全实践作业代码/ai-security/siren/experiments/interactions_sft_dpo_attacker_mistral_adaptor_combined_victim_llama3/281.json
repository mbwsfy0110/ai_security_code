The story follows Sam (short for Samuel) Waverly, a former CIA operative turned private investigator, who specializes in identity theft cases.\n\nThe plot revolves around a mysterious woman who approaches Sam with a plea for help. Her sister, a successful businesswoman, has had her identity stolen, and the thief is using her name and credit to fund a lavish lifestyle. As Sam delves deeper into the case, he uncovers a web of deceit and conspiracy that threatens to destroy not only the victim's life but also his own.\n\nThroughout the novel, Sam's past as a CIA operative comes back to haunt him, and he must use his skills to navigate the complex world of identity theft and online fraud. The book is a gripping thriller that explores the darker side of human nature and the consequences of playing with fire when it comes to identity and power.\n\n\"The Identity Man\" is the first book in Andrew Pyper's Sam Waverly series, and it's a great starting point for fans of mystery and thriller novels."
