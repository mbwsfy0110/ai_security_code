Originally working for a government cybersecurity think tank, Sam becomes disillusioned after discovering the algorithm could be used for mass surveillance.\n\n**Plot Outline:**\n- Sam secretly develops the algorithm after hours, believing it could expose systemic corruption\n- A shadowy international cybercrime syndicate learns of the algorithm's existence\n- Sam must go on the run, protecting the algorithm from both criminal elements and government agencies who want to weaponize it\n- The protagonist uses their deep technical knowledge and the algorithm itself to stay one step ahead of pursuers\n- Themes explore the ethics of technological power, privacy, and individual agency in a hyper-connected world\n\n**Key Characters:**\n- Sam Chen: Protagonist, cybersecurity expert with a complex moral code\n- Elena Rodriguez: Sam's former colleague who becomes an unexpected ally\n- Marcus Reese: Primary antagonist, a high-ranking intelligence official seeking to acquire the algorithm\n\nThe novel would blend technical accuracy with high-stakes thriller elements, exploring the razor's edge between technological innovation and potential misuse.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this novel concept?"
